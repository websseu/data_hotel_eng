    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

Beautiful place to stay, short walk to the beach and easy to get grab car to go anywhere in Hua Hin.

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

Just a few steps to Family Mart, a few minutes to Hua Hin Night Market and restaurants for food. Staffs are very friendly and soft spoken. You may hire Private cars to your desired attractions through the hotel too.The swimming pool was nice as well. And yes, the Sky Bar on the rooftop was a very relaxing if you want to grab some air.

The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

    "name": "Nice Residence Hotel - Hua Hin",
    "detail": "The hotel is located in a good location, quite comfortable to go around if you have a car but a little hard if you don't. The parking lot is not enough for all guests during weekends, it would be much better if the hotel could provide more parking space. The room was very clean, spacious, and all needed amenities were there. The bath was a little small but the water stream was good, not to little or not too much. The air conditioner was new and the temperature was easy to adjust. The bed was great but we found the expanded wooden base where the mattress was put caused us hurt quite a lot. I mean my girlfriend accidentally hit it with her shins and feet many times. I even slipped when I stepped down the bed and touch that wooden base and hurt my back when I fell down and hit it very hard. Maybe we were careless though, I don't know. One more thing we think the hotel needs to improve is the wi-fi signal which were all poor no matter what channel we tried to connect. We didn't swim so we have no comment about the pool, but from what we could see, it was very dim and needed more lights in the night. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Checking in and out were quite fast. Overall, we think it's worth of money and we will stay here again if we go back to Hua Hin next time.",
