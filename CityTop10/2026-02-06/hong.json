    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

It has al the mod-cons in the room including a massive LED TV with a welcoming message for you and even speakers in the bathroom. Going to this hotel also really helped as I arrived at about 1am in Hong Kong and so didn't need to look for taxis or late-night transport and then hassle with check-ins in Hong Kong City. Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

    "detail": "This place is great for the price. Don’t listen to all the poor reviews as they are expecting too much for the price. This is a budget hotel, and for that category it ranks pretty high. I have stayed at other more expensive hotels in Hong Kong and this place ranks better in many areas. The location is excellent. It is only two blocks from the MTR station. The price was great, one of the cheapest accommodations you can find in Hong Kong. The air condition works really well, and that’s a must in Hong Kong. The WiFi is also strong, never had any weak signals or connectivity issues. There was always hot water for a shower, and there was no need to boil drinking water. They had a hot and cold water dispenser by the reception. The only con I could possibly say about this hotel is that the elevator is shared with residents of the holding, creating a long wait for a single elevator. But for the price, what can I expect. Overall this is a good hotel and I would be willing to return.",

    "detail": "A group of 4 of us stayed in the newly renovated family room for 5 days. Everything was superb! The entire hotel had strong air conditioning which is a blessing in humid Hong Kong weather. We were a 5 minute walk away from the Times Square shopping area and had extremely easy access to calling taxis (which are very affordable in Hong Kong or the hotel can call you a taxi if you can't catch one) or buses/vans/MTR stations. There is a Sharetea and McDonalds down the block for people trying to minimize their daily walking. Everyone overall speaks English well and are very courteous. They will ask you for a 1,000 HKD cash security deposit for the room and it will be a quick 5 minute process to check the room/ return it to you when you check out. Cleaning ladies are the sweetest and do a very thorough job (vacuum everything down to the last speck of dust) and the gym has great variety. Will definitely stay at Charterhouse again the next time I visit HK. Thanks!",
