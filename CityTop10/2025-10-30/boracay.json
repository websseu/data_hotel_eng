    "detail": "Great beachfront location close to D’mall. Sky pool bar is a huge attraction and definitely is this hotels USP. Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

    "detail": "I must give 2 thumbs up for their hotel transfer service, journey from Kalibo airport to Boracay island is full of twists and turns, but they manage to keep track of everything and provide a smooth transfer from land to sea to land, it's highly recommended. It was a surprise for us at the moment we found out the shuttle bus to pick us up is from a 5 stars hotel, turns out Hennan Lagoon is a sister company of a hotel franchise, as a guest there we have free access to the 5 stars hotel's beach and a welcome drink at it's lounge. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The surroundings of this hotel is a bit noisy, but once you step into the lobby it become a different world, room is clean and quiet, swimming pool is well maintained. We had dinner buffet at their restaurant on the first night, food is ok. There are plenty of restaurant at the beach, which is only 5-10 mins walk from hotel.",

The facility is truly beautiful, a modern and enjoyable design. Cleanliness is 10/10. The concierge assisted me with booking activities on the island with recommended providers, making it simple and stress free. This is one of the best hotels in Boracay. I recommend it to anyone. I will be returning to the Lind without a doubt :)",
