    "detail": "Great convient hotel in Hua Hin. Rooms are small, but they are clean and modern and the beds are the most comfortable ones I've slept in. We chose this hotel because it was next to a friends condo. Access to the beach is good and there is a great night market 400 m from the hotel. Best thing was that we were upgraded to a family room, so a little more space and bunk beds for our little guy which he made into an extra playing area. The pool isn't the greatest, but good enough to get wet. Will definitely stay here again. ",

    "detail": "The hotel is located in a good location, quite comfortable to go around if you have a car but a little hard if you don't. The parking lot is not enough for all guests during weekends, it would be much better if the hotel could provide more parking space. The room was very clean, spacious, and all needed amenities were there. The bath was a little small but the water stream was good, not to little or not too much. The air conditioner was new and the temperature was easy to adjust. The bed was great but we found the expanded wooden base where the mattress was put caused us hurt quite a lot. I mean my girlfriend accidentally hit it with her shins and feet many times. I even slipped when I stepped down the bed and touch that wooden base and hurt my back when I fell down and hit it very hard. Maybe we were careless though, I don't know. One more thing we think the hotel needs to improve is the wi-fi signal which were all poor no matter what channel we tried to connect. We didn't swim so we have no comment about the pool, but from what we could see, it was very dim and needed more lights in the night. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Checking in and out were quite fast. Overall, we think it's worth of money and we will stay here again if we go back to Hua Hin next time.",

In the room, there were lots of plugs for charging devices, plus robes & slippers, and the wifi was fast. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless. The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

Staff very friendly, had to move room as extended stay due to enjoying time in Hua Hin and cleaner helped me move even taking out if drawer in 1 room and putting in same drawer in next room. Saved packing and unpacking into suitcase. Pool was nice, shame area around not so big and had to keep moving sun lounger to follow sun! But everything else made up for it! Definitely stay again!",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

    "detail": "As titled this is a brand new hotel, there isn't a sign from the main street to this hotel. Basically its next to Hua Hin Hospital coming down from Hua Hin Town towards Cha-Am. There's no sign on Phetkasem Rd (note to manager of hotel), you only see it once you turn in to soi 10. Hotel is not on the beach or tourist area, its basically in the middle of the main road between Cha-Am - Hua Hin. So if you want to get to anywhere you better have a rental or other means of transportation. There were only 5-6 rooms occupied when I checked in. So its very nice and quite. You seem to own the whole hotel complex. For The room, the finishing is OK and not really a 4-star. For me its more 3 stars, and as other reviewers the AC is really LOUD and also cannot get up to speed in terms of cooling. So better leave the key on when leaving the room unless you want to come back to a sauna. Swimming pool is small so I did not even bother, but do book a room with the jacuzzi on the terrace. Very nice for a quick dip. Breakfast was not a buffet style, understandable due to the number of guests they are still just opened recently. But with that the cook your own plate of A.B.F which is aplenty and very nice and fresh, the cooking lady even came out to greet us and ask about the food, which to me is a very nice gesture. Recommend this hotel if you are on transit or short stay in Hua Hin and plan to look around town/beach thus not staying much in-room. Not recommended if you want to stay and enjoy hotel facilities and all. ",

    "detail": "We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights at this hotel. The hotel staff was very kind and friendly. The location is very strategic. It is walking distance to Hua Hin Village Mall, bus station and 2-3- minute walk to the beach. 100 meters to 7/11 store. The breakfast was quite ok. The room was clean but a little bit small for 3 of us. You could also hear the noise of people outside. The hotel offers car rental and that’s great if ever you want to go the other spots in Hua Hin. The WiFi was not that strong on the 5th floor where we stayed. I turned it off and used my 4G. Moreover, I will recommend this hotel to my friends and maybe plan to stay here again soon. ",

    "detail": "We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The price was exceptionally cheap and yet the air, internet, and staff performance were all great. This is one of the best 'budget' hotels that we've found in Hua Hin, but also in most of Thailand. The furniture and decor is a bit dated and beat up, but it doesn't detract from the stay at all. Great value for money at this hotel.",

    "detail": "When I first checked in I was not given the mountain-view room I had booked, but after complaining I was moved to the correct room. The room was very large and very clean. The fridge was full of drinks for reasonable prices. The mountain view from the 4th floor was phenomenal. The road the hotel on is a very nice and quiet side street connected to the main road where the baht buses frequently run up & down (10 baht per ride). It's a short walk to the beach and the hotel is situated near a crosswalk which makes crossing the busy main road somewhat easier. The hotel's lobby and entrance is very nicely decorated. I searched agoda.com for a very long time to find the right hotel in Hua Hin, and I am glad I eventually found this place. *Key note: If you stay there, you will likely run into a few stray dogs who hang out on the front steps. BE SURE TO STOP TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES PETTING THEM. THEY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. ESPECIALLY THE OVERWEIGHT TAN DOG. ",
