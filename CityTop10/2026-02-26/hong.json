    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

    "detail": "L'etoile de Mer is probably one of the more high-tech boutique hostels to be joining the hostel scene in Hong Kong. Check-in is done in on a self-service machine much like the self check-in kiosks at the airport and you shouldn't have much problems as long as you follow the posted instructions. FACILITIES: The capsules are quite spacious and comfortable. Strong sense of privacy and security since the keycard is needed to open the capsule from outside. Common areas and bathrooms were very clean. Loved the free toiletries provided. WHAT COULD BE BETTER: I only stayed one night but I found an ant crawling on the bed in the evening and killed four more the next morning. This was the only downside throughout my stay but it'll spiral into a larger problem if not addressed by management soon. TIP: Only one locker (fits one medium-large bag) assigned to each guest. After check-out, you can set your bag in the open area but the lockers will need to be made available for guests checking-in.",

You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

    "detail": "Uhm...where do I even start? I travelled with a friend and upon arrival we could not get two double beds. That's not a bad thing at all. We were completely A-OKAY with this set up. When we went into our room though, we were ECSTATIC. Biggest double bed I have ever seen in Hong Kong. Fit the both of us and then some perfectly! Super comfortable. Fell asleep in bed each day like a baby. We stayed for six and the second deciding factor was definitely the floor. NO CARPET. LOVED THAT. The first was the bathroom. We did not like having a set up where the toilet and the shower were combined. But this bathroom was clean with a sliding door divide for the shower! I don't know how many hotels I have found that did not do that or were not as clean as this one! And the size of the room was PERFECT. It was a lot bigger than we imagined because space in Hong Kong is limited! There was even a mini fridge for you to use, which we totally did! Free WiFi made it all the more amazing as well. The lovely housekeeper and staff downstairs were also extraordinarily polite. Always held the doors open for us. I don't know about you guys, but I cannot recommend this place enough. It's also just a short walk to the Sheung Wan MTR. Complete convenience. But take into account that my friend and I love to walk. (Really, though, a five-minute walk is nothing.) Plus at night, it's totally quiet. We slept like babies. And despite getting a city view, it was still lovely opening up the drapes to massive windows. Our stay was amazing. My friend and I rave about our room many times during and after our stay. Thank you Ibis staff for making our trip back to Hong Kong THAT much more enjoyable. Much love! (The only con I can say is, it's not a very central location. If you plan on doing a lot of activities that are on Kowloon instead of on Hong Kong Island, it may be wise to go with another hotel. The MTR stops running at some point, folks. And taking a taxi all the time can cut into your budget!)",
