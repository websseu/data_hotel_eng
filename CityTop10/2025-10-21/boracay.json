    "detail": "Great beachfront location close to D’mall. Sky pool bar is a huge attraction and definitely is this hotels USP. Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

It has efficient and prompt shuttle services. We did not have to wait for a long time for the shuttles to arrive. Fairways has many of shuttles that are one call away. The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",

We. 1st we stayed in Henann Primier (station 1), Astoria (station 3), then Crown Regency (station 2). Here our reviews.. POSITIVE: - Airport transfer from Boracay airport to Hotel 550peso for both of us, cheap & must have! Because there are no taxi to get to Boracay. Hotel representative picked up us at exit of Boracay Airport, then transported us to catch a fast boat to Boracay Island, and arrived hotel 20min later. - The hotel representative picked up us at Crown regency in our last day in Boracay!, and transported us back to airport (included in 550 peso that we already paid) - Welcome drinks - Good attitude & always smile staffs - Clean & new - Nice pool access room! - Cost about 70peso to go station 2, to enjoy more shopping & food. NEGATIVE: - Overprice outdoor activities. Should book it at the beach, it is much cheaper. Such as Island Hopping 800p, Zip line/ Cable car 900p, Buggy Car 900p & Jet Ski 2000p. Note: There are no Taxi in Boracay, only have tricycle & e-tric. Very cheap, cost about 70peso to 100peso. Thank you Henann! ",

The hotel is totally new, it looks amazing, the rooms are great, it’s right on the beautiful white beach and the stuff are very kind and helpful! The hotel manager Glenn is great and was always around to make sure everything is perfect. Highly recommended for honeymoon or any visit in the island, we enjoyed every second :)",

    "detail": "I must give 2 thumbs up for their hotel transfer service, journey from Kalibo airport to Boracay island is full of twists and turns, but they manage to keep track of everything and provide a smooth transfer from land to sea to land, it's highly recommended. It was a surprise for us at the moment we found out the shuttle bus to pick us up is from a 5 stars hotel, turns out Hennan Lagoon is a sister company of a hotel franchise, as a guest there we have free access to the 5 stars hotel's beach and a welcome drink at it's lounge. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The surroundings of this hotel is a bit noisy, but once you step into the lobby it become a different world, room is clean and quiet, swimming pool is well maintained. We had dinner buffet at their restaurant on the first night, food is ok. There are plenty of restaurant at the beach, which is only 5-10 mins walk from hotel.",
