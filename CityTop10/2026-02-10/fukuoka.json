    "detail": "I had an absolutely wonderful stay at The Lively 2 months ago, while it was summer in Japan. I came back during autumn & wanted to try their pods. Positive: LOCATION. Best advantage of the hotel as it is w/in short walking distance to the subway, which is connected to the airport. Their area is pretty much awake. A lot of convenience stores and restaurants are open 24 hrs. CLEANLINESS. The hotel is relatively new. They just opened July this year. FRIENDLY STAFF, well personally, I find Japanese people helpful, polite and friendly. AND, you still have access to their free daily beer for 1 hr and unlimited coffee at their coworking lounge. Not so Positive: NO PROJECTOR in the pods. NO COMPLIMENTARY WATER BOTTLE. Only available for The Lively guests. TEMPERATURE. We found the pods really warm. We were sweating! They said they are trying to ctrl the temp as it was cold outside. Should've just maintained a cool temp. In the pods u have the option to close the fan anyway & u have blanket",

Rooms were clean with nice enough facilities. Staff were friendly, courteous and unobtrusive. The best part was the frankly lovely roof spa that was open all night and free for guests. Having a soak in the roof onsen in the open air after a night on the tiles was amazing. The only slight quibble I had was with the jammed elevators, only two to service the whole building, with the lobby placed on the 9th floor bizarrely. All in all though, I would definitely stay again. ",

It's just 1 min walk from the Hakata JR station, having 2 Family Marts right next to the hotel, with the bus terminal just less than 5 min walk, plus you can shop and dine till late at the JR Hakata City just next door. That's so convenient for everything, what else you would ask for more? The room is neat and all basic amenity are all there. The room size is just right or I would say it's a bit larger than my expectation for a Japan hotel. The staffs are nice and helpful. There's also an iPad in each of the guest rooms so saving us hassel in bringing us along. I would say Forza hotel is just too perfect for a trip in Fukuoka or a North Kyushu trip having Hakata as the hub. Hihgly recommend this! :) ",

Fortunately, Hakata Green Hotel turned out to be a really great experience. The hotel was right next to Hakata Station, which is only two stops from Fukuoka Airport. I was a little confused by the directions I got from Google Maps because I arrived at the place that is marked on the map and it turned out to be Building No. 2, and then there's an Annex. Building No. 1. is part of the complex, though, so once I realized that it was all on the same block, I had no trouble finding the hotel. I'm not sure how much English support the staff is able to provide, but my simple Japanese was good enough to get by. Check in was quick and easy, and the room was clean and comfortable with good facilities. I slept like a baby on the comfortable bed, and then I had breakfast at the buffet on the bottom floor the next morning. Most of the dishes were European, but there were some Japanese style breakfast items to choose as well, and the coffee was delicious. Overall, I felt like the quality was just right for the price, and I would stay here again.",

    "detail": "This hostel was really great. I made the reservation about 20 minutes before arriving due to a missed train, and as with most modern hostels I've stayed at in Japan it was wonderfully clean. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to Hakata, which isn't the best walk with suitcases, but the clean, comfortable bed made up for that. The entire facility was very clean, the breakfast was really nice as well. Cute outdoor space in the middle with a hammock. Might stay again if I visit Fukuoka!",
