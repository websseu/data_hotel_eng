    "detail": "This place is just amazing, the staff is very helpful and everything is so luxurious. We were a bit sceptical at first seeing no reviews on this hotel considering how big it is, but we're so grateful that we decided to stay here. Our flight left late in evening, so they also allowed late check-out for free and after that chill in the pool area. The breakfast was superb, the best I've ever tried and the selection was just enormous. And the infinity pool - so cool! Definitely will recommend to everyone if you are looking for 5 star experience.",

    "detail": "We stayed at the Lotte Legend Hotel from 6 September 2017 to 11 September 2017 in an executive river view room. We found the staff at the hotel very attentive and professional. They were always welcoming and would meet you with a friendly smile. The facilities and food at the executive lounge was always excellent. We have stayed at other executive (Club) rooms in many parts of the world and have always found them to be good. However, In this instance the big difference was the staff that served you. The staff and the supervisors at the executive lounge were willing to assist you with any request that you had. I like tuna sandwiches and hot fresh chili with my food and once the staff got to know about my liking, any time I visited the lounge, they would make sure that our table had an extra plate of tuna sandwiches and freshly cut red chili. Everyone who worked at the lounge seemed to love what they did, with two waiters who stood out. We had Jack who was always smiling, very attentive, polite, and willing to assist you with any request you had. Then there was Kyle, who was a consummate professional who was doing what he liked. After a day of sightseeing in the hot and humid climate that Ho Chi Ming City offers, it is refreshing to go to the executive lounge and have these wonderful personalities greet you and serve you with a smile. We will cherish the 6 nights we stayed at the hotel with fond memories of the wonderful characters that make your holiday more memorable than others. We traveled to Nha Trang and returned to the Lotte Legend Hotel on 15 September around 11 am and were presently surprised to find that they has already made a room available for us , although the checking time is normally 2 pm. We had booked a city view room for out last night in Ho Chi Minh City, but had been upgraded to a river view room. The next surprise was that when we went for high tea in the afternoon, Kyle greeted us and once again he had not forgotten the extra plate of tuna san",

They even let us check in early after a 20 hour flight. Nothing was to much for them. Amazing omelette station as well at breakfast! ",

My wife loves their Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) for breakfast. We also enjoy very much the privilege of the VIP lounge that offers happy hours every day from 5 to 7PM. With all of that, I also want to mention the staff that we are very happy with their service that include: Tran Thi Minh Ha, Nguyen Thi Hong Yen, Huynh Kim Vui, Nguyen Phuong Tram, Lam My Dung, Nguyen Ngoc My, Lam Thi Cam Van, Nguyen Phuoc Tung, Tran Du Hien, Vu Ngoc Huy and Le Duc tai.

    "detail": "This is the third time I have stayed in the Rex Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Each time I have enjoyed the suites which are luxurious and reasonably priced. The tours are very organized and punctual. This time on one of the tours we had to return early as a relative was not well and this was handled considerately and very professionally. This hotel has a grand white marbled floor and red carpet entrance and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are 2 well maintained rooftop swimming pools plus a rooftop bar that has appeared in numerous travel magazines. At the moment they are renovating some of the older room so there is some slight noise in the daytime but otherwise it was not too intrusive. The suites are lovely with large beds, clean linen and good facilities. When next I go back to Ho Chi Minh I hope to return here. ",
