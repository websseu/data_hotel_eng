    "detail": "My family and I stayed at hotel boss for 4 days in a family room with balcony (good for 4 pax).Over all the hotel room is brand new since the hotel just started last year. Everything are still crisp. Staff are all nice, helpfull, accomodating and smiling. The location is great, there are 2 MRT stations near it (Bugis Statiob and Lavender Station) which is about 5 minutes away through walking and a bus stop just right outside the hotel door. Mustafa center and bugis shopping mall is near. There are also tourist attractions near the area like Haji Lane wall art and Mosques. There is a 24/7 fast food chain (food clique) within the hotel premises which I find convenient because you don't have to worry getting hungry after a long day walking around singapore. A money changer, convenient store, restaurants, winery, and souvenir shops are also in the premises. I just hope they would maintain its cleanliness and beauty. Our room is small though for a family of 4. Our big suitcases can't just be open all the time because it'll obstruct our walk way and there is no closet. And also you have to request for a Do not Disturb sign, sometimes they're running out of it. Room lighting is nice and the wall art at the bed frame is beautiful. The balcony is big and spacious. Bathroom is nice, and clean with amenities; no bidet spray though. Shower temperature is good. Room is complete with compact fridge, tv, safety box, water boiler, and compimentary coffee & tea. The bed is good, didn't feel any back pain and good fluffly soft pillows. Nice hotel amenities with their pool overlooking Singapore Flyer and the tip of Marina Bay Sands. Generally the Hotel is at great great location, brand new, best value for money, and comfortable place to stay. I would choose to stay at this hotel again once I'm back in singapore. I would rate this hotel 9/10 üëèüëèüëèüëç. My family had a great time and payment is hassle free thanks to agoda ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç. Satisfied guest here! Great Job Hotel Boss! ",

    "detail": "We are so happy that we chose to spend 5 night a brand new Yotel. *The staff- Very polite caring and helpful. (the best staff we ever had in a hotel) They helped us with planning, adjusted for us the menu to our vegan twists, even cheak and printed for us information about an event in the city! *The location - Perfect location very close to ION mall and MRT station. we mostly used buses. it is nicer to see the city this way (bus stop is even closer and located in front of Thailand embassy) we also liked the hotel located on the beginning of Orchard street. it is very easy to take a bus to see all the street. Since it's a one way street you can get out each time in the stop you like. * The room - small as most rooms in Singapore hotels but designed very smart and functional! we felt like in a space-ship with cool view on the city skyline. * facilities - 10th floor is Amazing! the gym is very good and new! The restaurant is amazing with very good prices. We got a 50% discount for breakfast for choosing to eat only fruits and veges in the morning :) kitchen is open till 22:30 and we used to get nice evening vegan fruit and veges salad that was adjusted for us! Thank you so much for the warm hospitality. we relay appreciate every one of you! You are areal Pros! Best Regards, Daniel & Sarit ",

The rooms are spacious, very comfortable, great beds and bedding and wonderful showers. It‚Äôs a quiet setting and a good option if you have been travelling for a while. Transportation to Changi Cove is simple via buses from Pasir Ris or Tampines. Very easy to get around and a 15 minute walk to Changi Village which has everything you may need. This has got to be one of the most affordable hotels in Singapore (price includes a very nice breakfast) for the comfort, the quality and the approach of staff. Thank you once again to Ramin. See you soon Changi Cove. ",

Another plus is the location, situated right on top of Outram MRT station provides easy access by subway and trains. It is also located right at the start of Chinatown and provides a good location to explore Chinatown while being far enough to be quiet. There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance from the hotel. Travel to other parts of Singapore is easy by the MRT subway just beneath the hotel. We did not have breakfast provided but it was not a problem as there are plenty of restaurants and fast food a short walk away. Overall, this hotel excels with the service, friendly and help staff, clean and comfortable rooms, centrally located with easy access to train service.",
