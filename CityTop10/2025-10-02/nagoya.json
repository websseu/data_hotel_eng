    "detail": "Very clean facility with comfortable beds and they provide towels, hair dryer, shampoo and co. Which is great! They have two separate elevators, one for male and one for female. Their is a nice lounge on top of the facility and the staff was friendly! They only thing that was annoying is that that you have to check out everyday around 10 am even if you stay several days. That means no sleeping as long as you want. However if you stay longer you can at least keep your luggage in the locker. I recommend this place if you stay only one or two days in Nagoya.",

Nice that there is a 'pantry area' with free unlimited self-service hot and cold drinks. Breakfast buffet spread is really good and better than other dearer hotels I have stayed around Nagoya. 1 minute walk to an underpass leading to subway station which is one stop from Nagoya main station. Lost of good food options if you explore the hotel vicinity. This is the best hotel out of the 3 different hotels we've stayed in Nagoya during our trip. Will be back...",

If you come with heavy luggage, would recommend to use the exits with escalators or elevators, which will land you inside other building (but you can find your way out just fine), but it's better than lug those bags upstairs. The hotel itself is quite new and located in the middle of nightlife neighborhood, so there're bars everywhere. The room, the bed is quite comfy, but no air humidifier which I think should have been provided during winter. The breakfast was 'The Best'. I loved the traditional Japanese ingredients for the rice very much, especially the black paste. The coffee making machine was awesome. By the way, I happened to have seen the controversial book 'The Real History of Japan' that you purposely placed in the room. It's ABSURD. And since I saw the news that you are going to remove it, I'll have no complaints about this.",

    "detail": "We checked in on 3 May. Golden week in Japan so not really value for money. It was a night in transit from Takayama to Kyoto. A surprise upon arrival : it was a big room, twin queen size bed, not twin single size bed. Plenty of space to put your luggage in the room. The hotel has a small onsen / public bath. The location is great : 2 stops away from the JR station, right next to the Osu Kannon district and its shopping streets. After 10 days in Japan, we felt like Western food for a change and came upon one of the best Italian restaurant we ever dined in : Cesari. The service was relatively slow but the food was divine, and great atmosphere. Little interaction with the staff but checking in and out.",

    "detail": "The hotel itself was fine and staff were very nice, The price included clean pajamas which got changes as well as the bed linings every day. The price also included breakfast. The location is within the walking distance to many central attractions of Nagoya, also very easy to find places to eat. The only thing stood out was the rubbish on the pavement outside of hotel (nothing to do with the hotel). Japan being such a clean country, it was unusual to see any litter normally, but for the 2 days we stayed in this hotel, the street where the hotel was covered by a lot of litter, which was a shame. For that reason, we can not give it a 5 star for location.",
