    "detail": "There was a mistake in my booking & I realized only during check-in. However thanks to Agoda & KSL, I managed to resolve the problem & the staff who attended to me (tall Malay girl) was very patient & helpful. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Shopping is just downstairs. Breakfast was good with many variety on offer & helpful staff. Guests can rest at the lounge while waiting for check-in (brilliant idea - wish more hotels can do this!) Only grouse was the parking. I checked in on a Sunday & the mall parking was full so had to drive up to the higher levels. Small thing & did not in anyway affect my stay here. I highly recommend KSL Resort to anyone wanting a good hotel in Johor Bahru.",

    "detail": "Stayed for a night in their one bedroom, it was beyond my expectation and far best stay so far in Johor Bahru. Apartment is newly opened. The parking was quite safe and I can assure that - especially for Singaporeans who have second thoughts on parking their motorbikes in Johor Bahru. The security guards were very attentive, seen them doing round checks in the premises. The check in was swift and the rooms are really clean and comfortable. Check in time was at 3pm but we checked in way earlier around 2pm. Was issued a room key however it was not really ready when we were outside our room. Waited for 10 minutes to be in the room but it is fine for me. Location is good for solo travellers too as the hotel was just a walking distance to Komtar JBCC and City Square. There’s 7-11 convenient store just right at the hotel lobby in case you need to get something urgently. Now, the cons about the apartment was the parking you have to pay on your own. (It comes with a price I guess) And the major turn off - their housekeeper was very rude. Knocked the door several times at 10:45AM to tell us to check out when we clearly knew the check out time was 12PM. Leave that alone, the housekeeper repeatedly knocked the door again at 12PM SHARP. How intense was that. I dont remember requesting the front desk to get someone for my wake up call. She was also rude when we asked the other housekeeper to confirm the check out time. She gave us her unpleasant death stare and walked away when the other housekeeper was apologizing on her behalf. Very rude and unprofessional. I hope the management can look into this matter. Other than that, theres nothing much to point out. Will still give the 5 star rating! ",

But that was totally wrong when i step in to the hotel reception. we were welcomed with a big smile the receptionist also is very friendly. Step in the room, i was amazed with the modern deco & a very clean room.. When i enter to the toilet, i feels like i was at my home's toilet.. Eventhough the hotel does not provided hotel car park, but i am very satisfied with my stay there... when we were hungry, we just have to walk in behind the hotel building & there were lots of food stalls with variety of foods to choose. Shopping?!! just walk beside the hotel building & you can shopped at City Square, Johor Bahru.. Overall, staying in Citrus Hotel, Johor Bahru giving me a different view on budget hotel & i will definitely choose this hotel if we come to JB in future... ",

    "detail": "Stayed at Amari for one night with my partner and I must say the hotel's location is fantastic and ideal for a short trip across the Causeway. It is just a short walk from the Johor Bahru checkpoint and across the road from two popular shopping malls — City Square and Komtar JBCC. In terms of customer service, we had a pleasant check-in experience and received a free upgrade to a junior suite (we had originally booked an executive club king room). The room was spacious, comfortable and clean, nothing to complain about at all. The pillow menu we found at our bedside table was a nice welcome touch as well although we did not utilise it. Breakfast buffet selection was also quite varied and we enjoyed it very much. We did not manage to try the rest of the dining options at Amari given our short stay. While Amari's rates are certainly more expensive than the average hotel in Johor Bahru, I'd say it's worth the splurge especially if you're looking for a nice place for a quick getaway.",

    "detail": "Simply one of the best I've experienced around the world, and definitely the best, the number 1 choice if you are looking to stay in Johor Bahru. Excellent location, just beside KSL shopping, of course you have ksl resort as an option which is located above the shopping mall, but the staff service is nothing compared to the ones at Holiday villa. The cleanliness, the room, the comfy bed, the infinity pool (as raved by many), and above all, the staff service was simply awesome. You can never find a hotel better than this in Johor Bahru, if not the whole of Malaysia, and beats alot of hotel hands down world wide. At an affordable rate of average $85 per night, you can have all the best sleep of your night. 5 star rating and recommend to all to stay here. ",

But it's clean (to me) and it has a private bath and shower. I can stay here for a 4 or 5 days for the price of one night in a small Singapore Chinatown hotel or for the same price as a low end youth hostel. Then again I like eating at the street restaurants with the local people. This is not a place for the people who need to see eye candy all around them.",
