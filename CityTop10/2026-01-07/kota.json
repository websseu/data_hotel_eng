If you're driving, then this hotel will leave you worry-free since there are plenty of parking space provided with security guards. Also it's very close to Imago Shopping mall.",

    "detail": "It seems a little bit pricey for the average traveler but Kota Kinabalu is more expensive than Peninsular Malaysia in general and it costs far less than Meridien. But if you have a bit to spare, it's well worth it for the size of the room, the amenities and the location is fantastic. Lots of food options within in walking distance - if you need to get to a mall Centrepoint is just across the road, Imago is 5 minutes away by cab. Use GRAB cab wherever you go - it costs far less. The waterfront, boardwalk dining options & massage, market etc are all nearby. The Warisan area that it is located in seems a bit foregone but you can walk around it and it doesn't seem dangerous or dodgy. If you are heading out to the isladns, the jetty is also not far away. Best bet for Kota Kinabalu (even when I had to go for a conference in UMS I stayed in Klagan). ",
