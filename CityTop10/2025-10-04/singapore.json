Lots of decent nearby shops and restaurants. Staff in hotel were all friendly and accommodating. Overall we had a very good experience staying here. Only slight downside was the view from our room on the third floor, which was obstructed by the top of a palm tree. Recommend paying more for a better room at this great hotel.",

    "name": "Village Hotel Changi by Far East Hospitality",
    "detail": "After 10 years of regular travel to Singapore we've stayed in pretty much everything in this beautiful city from Raffles and the Ritz Carlton to backpacker walk ups in Little India. We reckon Changi Village Hotel is the best 4 star hotel in Singapore. It's great value in a great little village with real atmosphere, where genuine Singaporean residents live. The strip of bars, restaurants and shops is just footsteps from the hotel entrance and has everything you need for a great stay. The stunning sea views offer the perfect backdrop to a relaxing trip. If you want the bright lights of the city centre it's still only 30 minutes away by cab. I guess most people know the hotel as a short stopover spot for transit passengers from the airport. I'm sure it works fine for that but it has SO much more to offer for a longer stay. The rooftop pool is a joy and the fitness centre is well equipped too. The Executive Lounge on the 6th floor is as good as any you'll find anywhere with a great coffee selection, PC access, reading material and a lovely outdoor balcony to enjoy. The rooms are clean and spacious with wonderfully comfortable beds and cool, modern bathrooms. But the real secret to this hotel is the staff. Even though they face high guest turnover with the airport sector they treat each guest with warmth and courtesy and never miss an opportunity to help out or offer a friendly greeting. There's something very genuine about the whole experience and I'd say they make great ambassadors for Singapore. I sometimes travel alone and sometimes with my wife and young daughter but either way these people make me want to come back again and again. A hotel should be welcoming and this one is. Sure, there's a bit of faded paintwork here and there, the corridor carpets are probably due for a change and the exterior facade has some green algae spots that need removing - but forgive those minor fair wear and tear issues and you'll discover a hotel with real heart and soul, a diamond.",

Also awesome that minibar is free and drinks are free....nice and easy to grab a drink by the pool and not stress about how big the bill at check out will be. Even the toiletries werre great. Usually the shampoo and conditioner at hotels doesnt feel like it does anything but this stuff was great and smelled amazing. They could do with a business centre for business travellers though. We needed to print documents out and they printed some pages free for us but then charged us when we had lots to print (understandably) but all this was done at concierge. Really funky boutique hotel that is in an awesome location in orchard. Other boutique hotels are located further out or near financial district. This one was easy walking to the shops. Free wifi throughout hotel is great (many other hotels charge a ridiculous extra for Internet). Highly recommended,possibly one of the best hotels in Singapore. ",

    "detail": "I booked a deluxe room at the new Oasia Hotel for a small break from our routine here in Singapore. I've watched the building go up and I was curious as to what the inside looked like, and was also intrigued by the hotel's club. Overall it was a 4 star experience - here's what I liked and what could be improved. The good: The staff were perfect and were kind enough to send us chocolates. That's always good. The room was on the smaller side, but everything clicks into place and was finished with a good attention to detail. The bed was comfy and clean. I liked the light switches on both sides of the bed. The shower was powerful and the towels were so nice and fluffy. The gym looked great. The eggs and juice at breakfast were nice. The average: We booked the room for half price, as they were having an opening deal. Even at half of the normal price, I felt like we did not quite receive the level of luxury expected from a luxury hotel. It felt like a nice business hotel. The pool felt pretty small (which can't be changed) and cold (which might be a good thing here in SG). The keycards won't work in the elevators or doors unless you press them all the way against the reader. Breakfast was $20 each, and wasn't particularly good. Either the milk or the coffee tasted funky - I'd hope for some tastier stuff at a place like this. I'd save your money for some of the good cafes nearby. Overall, I would recommend this for business travelers. Perhaps regular life in Singapore has pampered me so much that my expectations for luxury are too high. ",

Was offered early checkin a payable room upgrade which did not opt for. Rooms were very clean and bed was very comfy but rooms are very small . With 2 luggages open there won't be a place to stand also but guess that's common in all hotels in Singapore. The best part of the hotel was the Handy phone which was provided which helped us during the stay and also book Attraction tickets with huge discounts. ",
