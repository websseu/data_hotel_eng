The staffs at the front desk are nice and helpful, there is a free welcome ice-stick that you can get at the counter as well as slipper etc. The room is super quiet and clean with a mini fridge and shoe shelves. There is a nice common room with long work table, pantry bar and smoking room beside. It looks cool. In the washroom there is toilet, washing counter, make up desk and access to the shower room- shower gel, shampoo and conditioner is included. Clean and proper. Although quite some people staying, I don't feel too crowded, this is a very comfortable stay. Also it's just right besides the pier, harbour walkway and hilton hotel. The American village is just walkable!!! Alot of lovely souvenir stores and restaurants there, also a museum and beach on the other side. I shall have booked at least one more night here!! I would definitely come again if there is chance I visit Okinawa in future.",

The beds were excellent, and we really loved the public bath upstairs, which was a godsend after a day of walking. They have a lounge where you can get coffee and soft drinks, as well as provide umbrellas to borrow if it's raining that day. Although they have limited parking, they will immediately direct you to another parking building opposite if the hotel one is full. This is a tiny bit cheaper than the hotel parking, but is still secure. Don't worry about not having parking if you're renting a car (which you should to get around the best sites in Okinawa). Excellent service, excellent place to stay and I'm surprised it's only rated as 3 stars. With the amenities, I would have expected this to be rated 4 stars. I would not hesitate to stay at Almont Hotel again, in Okinawa or one of their other hotels around Japan.",

The hotel was immaculately clean and the room / cabin is sufficient for few nights as it is minimalist approach but still well executed. Towels, pajamas, safe for your valuables, slippers and comfortable bed even for me 1.88m tall guy. The folding doors are not really sound proof but when respecting the no talk on the phone rule and when you put your mobile to silent mode than it is o.k. Yes you will hear people walking down the corridor but this is the price to pay for this kind of accommodation but as traveler I always have ear plugs as they are number one necessity, even in some hotels. Bathrooms and shower facilities are amazing as the cleanliness and layout including the toiletries are well matching some five star hotels. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to stay Japanese style for relatively cheap money and experience something different. ",

It's a little far from the airport and other scenic spots, but u can take the bus at the airport that can help u to reach the hotel directly. If u want to visit the Ocean Park, u can take part in the one-day tour on the lobby, but u need book it in advance. The hotel attendants are very enthusiastic. They provided us with good service, when we stayed there. The breakfast and the hot spring are perfect. When u go to the resturant for breakfast, u can find western and Japanese traditional food there. My friend and I liked local Japanese traditional food very well. This hotel is very close to American Village. There are many small Japanese resturants. U would find that the price is not expensive and the taste is delicious. If u want to buy Japanese make-up and Japanese snacks, u also can find the store there. And the price is cheaper than other places. And there are also some exotic store and resturants there. Our room was very clean and faced to the sea. It was very beautiful in the night and morning. I think this hotel is very suitable for family to live there, there are a small monkey and a big sea turtle there. Children are always interested in these. There are some small stalls and a small supermarket. It's very comfortable. If u drive there, it's very easy to park there. If I go to Okinawa again, I would still choose this hotel.",
