I booked the Straits Suites and it was huge! downside was the balcony was locked and you are unable to get access, suspect they locked up due to safety issue. The place was just beside Hattan Square therefore it is quite centralised. Need to cut across a small dark alley from Hatten hotel to reach Straits. Felt quite unsafe walking through the alley. (Unless you drive around in Malacca) Carpark was easy to manoeuvre as compared to several other hotels. Friendly staffs, brighten up your stay in hotel. Did not provide most things in suite example : pots, bowls, eating utensils (So why you provide a stove to cook?) No hair dryer so beware ladies if you need 1. xD Feels more like you are at home, in a service apartment than a hotel. (Flooring is not those hotel carpet) I like. xD Thumbs up for the front desk ladies for the big smiles you gave me when checking in and out! I'm sorry I forget your name. ;( ",

The rate is quite cheap, given that they have an attached bathroom for each room. Other hotels in Malacca offer shared bathrooms with the same price as Hotel Hong. Upon arriving at 9:00 pm, the kind receptionist, Ah-May gave us our room key as well as the WiFi password. They also provide a map. When we asked about some good restaurants or places to visit, she offered to tour us around the vicinity so that we would know where to go on the next day. Such a sweet gesture.. The room was very clean, the bed was big and very comfy. I loved the pillows and I had a good sleep. The only thing which didn't delight me was that there were no cable channels. Everything was in Malaysian or Chinese. It didn't bother us that much though, since our main agenda is to enjoy the unique environment in Malacca. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay near Jonker Street and Red Square.",

There was also white/wholemeal sliced bread which you can toast. On the last morning, perhaps due to smaller guest count - we could order whatever we wanted, ie eggs however and how many, with croissants. Staff were warm and friendly with always a ready smile.

    "detail": "Been queuing for more then 40mit to check in (I arrived hotel lobby at 3.50pm, 6.20pm to reach my room)while my turn to check in was informed one room has been upgrade to hotel tower so we stay separate tower with my parents (I booked residence tower). Over all my stay here for one night experience, my advise for you don't book residence tower as even is new hotel but the room no well maintain and the most important the lift, oh my god this is so horrible!!! I bet 10 customer out of 9.5 are complaining the same problem of the lift! 1) we waited lift just get to our room for more then 15mit , trust me is more then 15mit, there is 6 lift on 3A(reception floor) but only 4 lift can access to residence room and the lift no air-con can you imagine from 3A to level 20th floor(the highest 42 floor) the lift are full and need to stop at almost every floor the smell of sweat in lift so disgusting !空气不流通 2) My hubby call housekeeping ask to send toothbrush set Coz there is no provide in our room and we been wait for more then 40mit . hello is 40mit ,just to get toothbrush !!!! Terrible! I do went to my parents room which in hotel tower at level 11 floor ,the room maintenance and housekeeping/room services and the most important lift much better and faster we ask for extra pillow send to room just within 10mit, same hotel same management but service so much different. 3) on the second day before check out i took shower and wash my hair after all only realize there is no hair dyer at room my hubby call again to house keeping ask for it and still waited for 20mit just to send one hair dyer, really fed up of it My advise to Swiss garden malacca management : Your staff are friendly and good smiling enough, first thing to change is the residence lift must have a solution to solve the main problem and hire more staff. I Will only be back after have improvement otherwise no way, same price we can have many option and better hotel in malacca.",

    "detail": "I have stayed in many hotels in Malacca and Doubletree is the best! I feel so pampered during my stay there, as the staff are very attentive and the facilities are very extensive and top notch, e.g. the toiletries provided are Crabtree and Evelyn, not just any cheap product. Appreciate the chocolate nut cookie during check-in too! Hygiene is good but some spots are easy to miss like the plastic piece at the bottom of the bathroom glass doors is completely black and definitely needs cleaning. Another thing is the housekeeping forgot to give complete sets of toiletries like the body wash was missing on my first day and conditioner was missing on second day. Both pillows provided are extremely soft, I suggest giving one plump pillow and another soft one so we can choose which texture we prefer. However, still my best stay in Malacca so far. ",
