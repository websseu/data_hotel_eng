The staff was very friendly and welcoming, with check-in and check-out very quick and painless. The triple family room was super clean, with the best beds ever. The room was made up promptly each morning. The room recommendation I would make is to have electrical outlets nearer to the beds so one could charge devices while using them in the beds. The breakfast buffet was adequate, but not spectacular. Overall I would highly recommend the Cosmos, and will surely stay there again when in Taipei. ",

    "detail": "Hotel's location is probably one of the best in Taipei being situated above Taipei Main Station MRT and having its own dedicated exit (M6). Hotel is at the more expensive end of the range of Taipei hotels but I felt I achieved decent value for money all considering. Room for a couple was perfectly adequate, though did not appear as large as some photos I had seen in advertising. However this might have been due to the enormous bathroom taking a fair amount of the room space. I would neither describe the room as dated or modern, somewhere in between, but comfortable and always clean. Air conditioning was very good and quiet in operation. Breakfast was buffet style and comprehensive; I was very happy with it, the fruit juices were some of the best I have tasted. Staff need a special mention as they were consistently delightful, polite, friendly and always helpful (they could speak English though my partner can speak Chinese). Overall a very pleasant 8 day stay and I would visit again.",

Besides, they have an iPad that allows you to control everything in the room with an app. Though you don't see the usual smart/butt-washing toilet but you get the smart lighting in your shower area in return. All in all, it's a nicely designed hotel which is also a good value for money. An obvious choice in the Taipei Station area.",

    "detail": "This being my 9th trip to Taiwan, I have stayed at a number of hotels from 5 star to 3 star. I would rank this as one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Taipei. I had orgininally booked for 3 days but ended up staying a total of 6 days. The location in excellent with the Ximen MRT station exit 5 just outside the hotel. The rooms are very modern and the bed is very comfortable. This is a new hotel and there are still some renovaitons in the lower level but nothing to be a hinderence at all to your stay. I have only some very small comments to make but once again nothing to be overly concerned by. The lip on the shower floor is quite low so the water does not drain away as quick so need to be careful of the water flowing over to the floor. While ther rooms are very spacious there is no where to put your luggage except on the floor maybe the room could have a stand that you can put your luggage on. The breakfast is delivered to your room from an external supplier. Not really to my liking as it was cold. I would have preffered maybe some pastries than the american style that was delivered.. My final comment and this is not a critisicm of this hotel but of most in taiwan. I would like to see an iron and ironing board in the rooms. Overall I must say I was very impressed with this hotel and the staff. I will definately be booking this hotel again on my next trip.",

Makes it easy to get to airport via HSR (+1 transfer onto the Airport Line) and to Taipei Main Station. Located on the Blue Taipei Metro line, Ximen is just a few stops away. Breakfast is not an issue as there is a shop that sells cheap traditional Taiwanese breakfast right opposite the hotel. 2 Family Marts located beside the Hotel and a larger one located in Banqiao station which sells all the souvenir that you need (e.g. ChiaTe)",

Also close to 東區 shopping district. There is supermarket and wet market just downstairs of the hotel. It may not have international 5 star lobby and restaurants, however, one won’t spend much time in the hotel in Taipei anyway. The staff are all v welcoming n helpful. I love the design and architecture of the hotel with nature as the theme. It has a lounge area where u can grab some drinks n fruits. The room is spacious, clean and equipped with nespresso machine. Only complaint is that the toilet and shower area not very separated. N there’s only a curtain to segregate bathroom n bed. May not be v convenient if travelling with friends n big families. Overall breakfast buffet is nice but would appreciate more varieties. Would be back!!",

    "detail": "As the title says, everything here is good. At least for tourists. It is about 5-8mins by foot from Ximending and Beimen stations. If you are a late-night kind of person, you will like it here - right down the street you could easily find convenience stores as well as 24hrs MOS Burger! If you are into local street food, there are also 24hrs hawkers to fulfil your midnight cravings. As for the service, very friendly and helpful front desk staffs. Interior design is one of a kind - modern and pleasant. As it is still new, everything is in order, and most importantly, clean. I hope that the cleanliness could be maintained even when the facilities get older. Only thing is that it is a little pricey (but hotels in Taipei are generally on the expensive side), and that there are no windows in the room. ",

The staff are very friendly and can speak English. The area is near the MRT and Ximen which is a place for good shopping and just entertainment during day but mostly at night. Most of all, very budget friendly! The free wifi is sure plus for people to stay connected online. It was my first time traveling doing backpacker style and I will say I will do it again especially in Taiwan and in FunInn Taipei! Really was great experience for me. I'll be back soon and will see you again, FunInn Taipei!",
