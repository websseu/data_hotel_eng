    "detail": "i Have stayed in many hotels in pattaya before and none of them come anywhere near the standard of this one . This hotel is fantastic, spotlessly clean , the rooms are beautiful, the shower is so powerful on the bathroom it’s lovely . The dining area is gorgeous and the breakfast is lovely with lots of choice . The staff are all amazing , professional and very friendly . And on a personal note I would like to send huge thanks to Bungkee and Oliwia on reception, I had many problems whilst I stayed there as I had a very bad accident at another hotel . Bungkee and Oliwia are an absolute credit to that hotel , they helped me so much with many different problems and nothing was too much trouble for them . I cannot thank them enough . I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone . Again , many thanks to all the amazing staff especially Bungkee and Oliwia xx",

    "detail": "We stayed at the Dusit Hua Hin last year for our anniversary, but this year we thought we'd try the Pattaya location. From parking the car to walking into the lobby, it's a rush of nice. The place just smells nice. There is an obvious emphasis to detail here. The room was comfortable and quiet. Bathroom great. Rain shower. Nice big balcony. I think this is better than the other hotels in Pattaya of similar rankings. Reason is, this one is actually on the beach, AND it is also on the main bay, overlooking all the other hotels which are NOT on the beach. So you have the best of it all. You walk down to the ground level and go to the beach right out your door. No crossing the street. Then, from your balcony, you sit and enjoy the great view of the Pattaya Bay with all the activity and the cool Pattaya sign lit up at night. Food wasn't that great we don't think. I think they have the effort, but need some new recipes. Not sure. It was just missing the wow factor. The pool was nice. Tennis courts on the water. Great view. Good service. Really clean. We'll be back again. ",

    "detail": "Newly opened hotel in North Pattaya since October 1st, 2020. The hotel is situated right before Amari hotel and within a short walking distance to Terminal 21 and the beach. We booked city view and had asked for a connecting room in which they then placed us on 14th floor room; overlooking Termninal 21 and some green area view which was good for us. Rooms were clean and well equipped with plenty of plugs and USB chargers. Amenities are Breeze, the same brand as Amari hotel. Fitness is opened 24 hours and located on 3rd floor of the building. It is one of our most impressive facilities as the room is big and has a full range of weight training equipment and machines. Swimming pool is also another stunning facility with perhaps 40-45 meter in length. They got kids' slider in the other pool too. Breakfast area is in EAT restaurant and it is huge. They also offer gluten free roll. We think, with a full capacity, this hotel should also be offering interesting breakfast lines. The Chill room offers board game, domino, cards, pool table, access to the Apple computer, etc. and also opens 24 hours. Parking is also good; indoor and plenty but not sure if with full capacity, it would be enough. Though the hotel has got outdoor spaces which should be fine. Overall for this trip, Ozo is in a good condition and offers reasonable prices and perfect facilities. ",

But all I recommend this location and I’ve stayed at several different Hotels in Pattaya but due to the price point and the location I’ll definitely stay here again ",

    "detail": "For a 4 star hotel you are not going to get anything better!!! A brand new hotel that is immaculate, gym, sauna, nice pool area and a great room. We had a Superior room with a queen bed that was so comfortable. Buffet breakfast was nice with plenty of options English, Thai and Indian. Location is perfect, on a quieter street set back a little but walk 2 mins up the street and you are right in mix for bars and everything Pattaya offers. Price point was fantastic value for money. You can not go wrong staying athe Hotel Amber.",

    "name": "March Hotel",
    "detail": "March hotel is a brand new property which provides you with best in class amenities within affordable price. I booked this hotel from Agoda with expectations of getting a class facility similar to April and August suites as the owner is same - and the hotel exceeded my expectations - I have previously stayed in April suites also so I trusted this new property - really they kept my trust. This hotel is managed, staffed and maintained to the highest degree and is excellent value for money. It is Located near to Tops supermarket( Central Pattaya) in a quiet street (very common in Thailand provincial towns), but the nightlife is only 3-4 minutes away. This may not be a 5 start luxury hotel but the interior design, decoration and layout makes it a very comfortable stay. The balcony is big, the fridge is big, the pool is well designed - in short it is much better than many of the 4 star establishments in Pattaya and elsewhere. I stayed with my 4 friends and one couple - all of them may not be free to write a review but on their behalf too it was rated the best value for money hotel. The receptionist Miss Julia took great care for all of us - she is very polite and caring. We started our stay very next day of the Grand opening of the hotel and I am sure the standards will be maintained in the coming years too. To close this review at last I would like to add - I really enjoyed my stay here, believe me and you will also. ",
