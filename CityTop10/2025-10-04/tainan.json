    "detail": "It’s not my first time to visit Tainan, but it’s definitely the best stay I had so far and I would love to recommend to my friends!! UIJ is close to the Tainan art museum expo 2 and it only takes 20 mins to the popular spots by feet. It’s very chic, stylish and clean! The staffs always had a smile on their face and great attitude. Make us felt truly welcomed and pleased. We especially love the fragrance oil that mixed with wood science they used indoor, keep us claim and relax. The room was great, air conditioning was strong and easy to modify, the leather slippers were very comfy. Personal I adored the refillable still and sparking water (in glasses bottles) and 1 soft and 1 more supportive pillows the most. The soundproofing of our room was ok, since I had been wakes up by some noise from the hallway or next room in the morning around 6:00... but I think it’s more reflect to the guests behavior instead of the hotel itself. Also the shared area and balcony were all well designed that you can enjoy the time chatting with your friends like home or seize the chance taking nice photos like us ;) Oh did I mentioned their breakfast? If I remembered right I think they offered 6 types of breakfast with drink bar. Usually I will save my stomach for the classic Tainan food, but their breakfast were surprisingly good! We stayed 2 nights so we tried 4 of them and we were very happy with them all. My friend and I really enjoy our stay. It’s prefect choice for couples, group of friends and solo travelers! But personally I think it’s not very suitable for the people who travels with baby or children. Since they do have various decorations and detailed designs in the building, but kids are looking for playgrounds to run and seek. ",

From the front desk to the executive lounge check-in, staff attitude and thoughtfulness, room decor, comfort and cleanliness...all these were impeccable and may even outshine certain SPG hotels I have stayed in Taipei. The only qualm is that room service is only up to 10pm, and though the food is very good (beef noodles..yum!), the selection is very limited. Would be good to extend or have have some simple late night room service menu, and a wider selection will be nice. Overall, I think it is a very professional hotel!",

    "name": "Tie Dao Hotel",
    "detail": "We chose the Tai Dao hotel both for its location, just opposite the Tainan train station, and its very reasonable price! We were travelling from Chiayi to Tainan by train, then onwards to Kaohsiung also by train, so the location was ideal. Exiting the train station, you are confronted with a very large and very busy roundabout - this serves in part as Tainan’s bus terminal. Looking across the road you’ll see the building in which the Tai Dao hotel is located, on the right side of the roundabout when facing it from the train station. There are two underpasses from the train station, those with heavy luggage should take the one on the left side of the roundabout as this one has lifts, up and down - then cross two intersections (controlled by lights) to get to the tall curved building that houses the Tai Dao hotel (plus a couple of food outlets, a 7Eleven, another hotel, and more). The Tai Dao hotel reception is on the ground floor to the right side of the building when facing the building. The underpass on the right side of the roundabout will bring you out closer to the hotel, but the steps are quite steep! With its location, you have easy access to trains and buses in Tainan, plus plenty of taxis readily available. The bus that takes you to the Flower Night Market (Tainan’s largest) stops right outside the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants in the streets around the hotel, and you can walk to many of the sights for which Tainan is renowned (we walked to the Confucius Temple, to the Chihkan Tower, and more). Check in was quick and easy. We were advised that each day we would need to present at reception to collect our breakfast vouchers for the following day. Breakfast vouchers included two coffee/tea vouchers plus two TWD60 coupons for use at the 7Eleven. We found the TWD60 was more than enough for a decent breakfast to start the day. We could get up to four sandwiches, or two hot meals (pre-packaged, heated up when purchased), or a number of buns/cakes - we certainly didn’t go hungry. The included coffee was the equivalent of a large coffee by Perth (Australia) standards. To get to the rooms you can either take the lift in the hotel’s lobby to the third floor, then switch to the building’s main lifts (unless of course you’re staying on the 3rd floor, we were on level 12 or 13), or walk around the front of the building, enter the building’s main lobby, and take the building’s own lifts directly to your floor. Our room was quite spacious, with two firm twin beds. There was a bench seat by the window that served as both a handy place to pop our cases, or a spot to city watch from on high. The room included efficient airconditioning, a mini fridge, and TV. The walls of the rooms are curved, which takes a little getting used, in that your beds are neatly pushed against the wall, but are not straight. The room was very clean, even when we moved one of the beds to get some distance (yes, we both snore), the floor under the beds was as clean as the rest of the floor! As an aside, with so very many rooms, we found that unless you specifically made note to reception that you wanted your room cleaned / made up, it didn’t happen every day. We passed the cleaning ladies in the corridors daily, while they didn’t speak a bit of English, they were very friendly and smiley (one even wanted a selfie with us)! On one day that our room wasn’t made up, we requested new towels, a bit difficult with no shared language, but we got there in the end and they were more than happy to oblige. If travelling with kids, do watch out for channels 14-17 as these are adult channels (we are a mother and daughter travelling together, it was an uncomfortable moment as I was flicking through channels, very quickly realising when channel 14 came on that this was not something I should be watching with my Mum, and even worse when I quickly changed channel and found the same genre on the next three channels - much relief was felt once I got back to “regul",
