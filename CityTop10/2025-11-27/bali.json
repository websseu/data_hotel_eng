I was a bit disappointed with the location of our room within the hotel (1st floor located above a bank of HVAC units that were loud and hot when outside on the balcony), but the room itself was fine. Location of the hotel is great, very close to the beach, a large market and central to tons of restaurants and shops. Too bad Kuta itself has become such a non-descript tourism ghetto. Nothing to do with the Kuta Paradiso Hotel, but I would not stay in Kuta again, I would look for a hotel near one of the other local beaches (e.g., Echo Beach) that are less crowded and still retain some Balinese character. There's nothing Bali about Kuta, unfortunately...",

Uber and Grab Taxi are allowed to pick their customer at this hotel (when I traveled to Bali on January 2017, I stayed in the same chain of this hotel : Fave Hotel - different location, and this other Fave Hotel didn't allowed Uber and Grab Taxi at their place) so I would really like to recommend this hotel. You can see the sunset as well from the top of this hotel where the pool also located, nice view and nice place. Will definitely stay again at this hotel when visit Bali next time, keep up the good work!",

    "name": "HARRIS Hotel Seminyak",
    "detail": "When we arrived at the Harris, we were greeted by Nico who made our check in a breeze. He was very freindly and gave us a fantastic first impression of the hotel. We booked a unique room which was brilliant - balcony, large comfy bed, great flat screen TV with heaps of channels, lots of space and great bathroom. The wifi at the hotel is fab, you only have to log in once a day. There are 5 swimming pools at this hotel, the flying pool is a little piece of heaven. The hotel is spotless, very clean. No matter what time of the day we left our room, within an hour of returing the room had be cleaned, fresh towels and complimentary water everyday. The location was great for us, 10 minute stroll to double six beach and all the bars. We took the complimentary buggy ride to the beach where the hotel has private sun beds for guests to use in the best location, they also provide free beach towels too. A ten minute walk in the other direction will take you to the Main Street in Seminyak. The buffet breakfasts in the hotel where a triumph, so much choice and the staff, every morning so friendly. The pizza restaurant was joy!! Awesome Italian style pizza, beautiful fresh salads, nice wine and great service. On the street where the hotel is located there are also a number of bars and restaurants, an awesome bakery and coffee shop, as well as spa's and a mini mart and circle k right on the doorstep - so convenient. We extended our stay for a further couple of nights, and stayed a week in total and we still don't want to leave. I have to commend the management for hiring such great people, the staff here are all so wonderful, always a smile and a hello and eager to help with anything you need. Having stayed in many hotels in Bali, the Harris is the highlight for us, and we can't wait to come back. Our friend is getting married and we have recommend the Harris to all our friends also coming to bali for the wedding. Thank you for such a wonderful stay 😃",

    "name": "Bali Garden Beach Resort",
    "detail": "Being a frequent traveler to Bali I have always stayed at Bali Garden Beach Resort for all the 5 star reasons above. The location is a 15 minute drive from the airport to hotel (subject to traffic) yet in all my stays never have I seen nor heard a plane.3 outdoor pools,great beach front restaurant with a killer view of sky and sea and located on the main street with enough food options,all cuisines at all prices.The front desk staff, the room attendants,the restaurant servers are the best of the best and easily solve problems and satisfy your needs.My only issue which I have mentioned to management is since the bathrooms have been updated with great fixtures and finishes they need to put a safety bar in the shower to prevent slipping and falls.The tile floors once wet can be a hazard to the elderly,kids or any age adult as they enjoy the wonderful rain shower and massage spray fixture.",
