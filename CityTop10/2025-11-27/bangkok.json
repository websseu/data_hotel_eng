    "detail": "We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while in Bangkok. The rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL, marble everything, great shower, nice tub for baths, free bath bombs, great feeling sheets. You definitely feel like your staying in luxury, but for such a reasonable price! The staff is very attentive and will rush to open the door for you when they see you coming back, carry all your suitcases for you, etc. For the price I don’t think you will be able to find another hotel in Bangkok that offers this much. The breakfast buffet was amazing, they had a western side and Asian side. In the afternoons they serve snacks available to the guests for free from 2pm-5pm which was nice. I would absolutely stay in this hotel again if I come back to Bangkok!",

    "detail": "Choosing a hotel in Bangkok is not easy since there are hundreds of options. We visited Bangkok as first-time tourists and we stayed first in Arcadia Suites Phloen Chit for 1 night but we are not satisfied with the location, so we decided to transfer here in Eastin Hotel Sathorn for 2 nights. Location is convenient because it is just right there in Surasak BTS. This is just one station away to Saphan Taksin where the Central Pier in Chao Phraya River is located. From this pier, you can take the Express Boats going to the Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Asiatique the Riverfront. This hotel is ideal if you are going to visit these spots. But if you are in Bangkok for shopping, I suggest you book hotels around Chitlom Station, near the Central World Shopping Mall and Siam Paragon. Room is spacious, clean, comfortable. The only one thing that is lacking is the toilet bidet. Our stay in Eastin is very relaxing and we appreciate the hotel comfort and ambiance a lot.",

    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

It was 8 hours later since I sent back the luggage and seems no luck on it as JoJo mention after he help to call the BFS. JoJo said he will stay connect with the BFS and let me know any update if need. Finally, BFS call me one hour later and said mine luggage was back to the airport and will sent back to the hotel I live! The next day I go back to Bell Captain, NJ saw my letter which provide by the hotel and already know what am I think of. My luggage is back!

    "detail": "For those who have rated this hotel/serviced apartment complex as anything other than wonderful you are either on drugs or in urgent need of seeing a doctor. I have stayed at the Grande Centre Point (GCP) on four occasions now – total of 32 nights – and I remain convinced it is not just one of the best located (direct access to BTS, main Sukhumvit Road etc) hotels in Bangkok but the best value. Yes, it is not everybody’s budget but for those happy at $100/120 per night (there are days, but not many, when these prices are significantly more expensive) don’t waste your time looking elsewhere. If having shopping on your door step is a plus, then you have the brand new Terminal 21 shopping centre. And you if you want cheaper shopping then the extensive range of street stalls on Sukhumvit Road are just outside. If gym work is a chore to you, the hotel has tried to make it much easier with an extensive array of equipment (not some puny little room stuck somewhere in a corner as with so many hotels in the City) – all with built in tv monitors. If you like a swimming pool and sun deck that is not just a paddle pool with some under-investment in sun loungers, then again GCP wins. And this is before you discover that there is a very generous area given to crazy golf and tennis. What other hotel in the City gives you these facilities ? Many of the great restaurants of Bangkok are on the Sukhumvit stretch, so you have all these within easy walking or taxi (or BTS) distance from you. Terminal 21 itself has many good quality eateries. For the ‘night lovers’ you have Soi Cowboy 100 meters away. Finally if there was a criticism I had in early stays at GCP it was the staff were under-trained but management have obviously put some time and investment into this critical service. So yes I can understand why some people will argue the case for other hotels in Bangkok (there are after all some magnificent ones in the City), they tend they tend to be in a significantly more expensive",
