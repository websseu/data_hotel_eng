    "name": "Grande Centre Point Sukhumvit 55 Thong Lo",
    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

    "detail": "This was the final of the six places I stayed in Thailand whilst traveling around the country . I stayed here for nearly a week. This place is newly re-furnished and thrives because of its staff and location. The staff are great and look after you as if you are family. They give great information on both local and national places of interest and also drew me out maps on occasions on how to get to places! Spending the late evenings learning Thai at reception (well counting to 5) was an added bonus as well as the shopping/markets/ travelling advice that I was given. The rooms were clean and have lockers. The location is very central with a BTS station less than a minute walk away that takes you to major places as did the boat that I took. The hostel is also in a great location to get the BTS 40 minute train to/from the international airport. This was a great place to stay and if I come back to Bangkok again, this is where I will be based. Thank you.",

The staff are super friendly – doorman, front desk, housekeeping, restaurant crew, rooftop bar and the gym. Our deluxe room is well equipped with kitchenette, a comfortable bed, wardrobe, big flatscreen TV. This corner room is so spacious that we feel that something is missing, perhaps a mini sofa or work desk will complete the look! We have an awesome view of Bangkok city with lots of windows and lots of sunlight. The only downside is the bathroom: water drainage is bad and the exhaust fan not working – wet floor, steam and smell takes a while to dissipate. Breakfast is at level 22 with amazing view. The breakfast is almost the same everyday, the food is delicious but boring. The highlight of this hotel – the swimming pool, rooftop bar and gym, located at level 33 – 360° view of Bangkok!",

This hotel is a splurge for me since I am traveling for a year but I still think it's a great value and so nice to have a modern clean cool room to come back to in Bangkok. After not having wifi for 3 weeks I literally sat in my room and got caught up with my writing and planning. I did think the food was expensive, and the mini fridge too, but I think it goes with a nice hotel in Bangkok. And it didn't stop me from utilizing both. The staff was lovely and let me use the pool for a few hours after I checked out. The location is great for cheap street food but the hotel has amazing food too. The buffet lunch is pricey for one person but really good. Nice huge television and very comfortable bed. Best sleep I have had in months.",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

    "detail": "I am going to book Dream hotel for the 4th time know!!!! This is the best affordable hotel in Bangkok to my opinion. The hotel is separated in 2 buildings. One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",
