We had booked two double rooms and were given 2 triple rooms. We appreciated the extra space. Rooms were spotless. The hotel is walking distance to a night market nearby. And supper is now provided as well at the hotel besides the free coffee/tea/drinks & ice cream. There is a laundry area (washer & dryer) too, which we find useful. Always a great stay when we are at Kindness. Looking forward to our next trip. ",

    "detail": "It was the first time for me to make a visit to Kaohsiung and I was little nervous by reading some reviews about this hotel beforehand as it said staff members wouldn't speak English and I couldn't speak Chinese at all. However, they were friendly and tried helping me whenever I asked them questions in English, although their English was not perfect but we could communicate. They also gave me some tips about places that would be worth a visit. Just a suggestion to users in terms of communication, you should also try understanding messages which staff members try conducting, not just expecting them to speak perfect English. They are nice if you are nice. As for the location, it is super convenient as located right in front of the Formosa Boulevard station (just one minute!?) and close to a long, busy night market which is totally nice. You can enjoy good street food in the market just 3 minutes away from the hotel on foot. Just the cleanliness and maintenance of facilities in a room could be better but I have no complaint about it according to the amount of money I paid. That was far better than I thought. If you are generally fine to stay at a hostel level, this hotel should satisfy your needs. Overall, I will book and use the hotel again if I have a chance to visit Kaohsiung again.",

    "detail": "We were not sure what to expect with the Grand Hi-Lai Hotel. Taiwan is filled with mediocre hotels that do not live up their price or prestige. We stayed in a Superior room with a view of the city and was pleased. Nothing about the hotel will blow one away. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and spacious. The bathrooms were clean, comfortable, and solid. Nothing was particularly special, but definitely worth the money to avoid staying in a run down hotel. Certainly the hotel could feel a bit more modern than the faux-European fancy decor suggested that seems [unfortunately] popular in expensive Taiwanese hotels. Service in the hotel was impeccable, and I rarely care about such a thing. The pool was quite nice [one of the reasons we booked here, as there are few hotels in Kaohsiung with nice pools], though the rule that one has to wear a swimming cap is just ridiculous [I know this is common in Taiwan-- but certainly is not Western tourist friendly]. Location is excellent. A few blocks to the Harbor/Love River and a few blocks to the Central Park area and MRT. So, if you are in Kaohsiung for a few days and want a comfortable room with a view, good location, and a pool, this is a good bet. I would likely stay here again. ",

A nice touch for the coffee machine at ground floor and there's a laundry room for travelers to wash our laundry(self-serve coin machine, there's dryer too). Buffet was nice enough but style doesn't change much. Something to work on would be the sound-proofing of the rooms could be better. I can basically hear every word outside the corridor and the sound of TV when I'm at the corridor. Staff was great and efficient and provided me help with all my requests. I suppose there;s different design in each level and rooms, suitable for family to stay too. ",

It's close to a 7-11 and Family Mart for drinks and snacks. It's about 20 mins walking to Liuhe Nightmarket and 10 mins to the nearest MRT station. For the price of the hotel and the amenities, this hotel will be on my list of must stays in Kaohsiung. ",

Room is clean and relative large (can fully open 29 baggage without blocking). Bed is large (Double bed room) No bathtub, just enterprise but i like it( maybe only my room type is enterprise). Shampoo, shower gel are provided. Staffs are nice and helpful. Even we are check in at very late night. 7-11 is very close to hotel, just 1-2 minutes away (typical Taiwan style, convenient stores everywhere). Fast food shop just next to hotel (MacDonald, KFC, Yoshinoya) its seem to open 24hrs. Apart from those fast food store, a lot of local Taiwan food store are also next to hotel (walk out the hotel, face to Kaohsiung station, left-hand side local food, right-hand side fast food) On the whole, its well worth the money",
