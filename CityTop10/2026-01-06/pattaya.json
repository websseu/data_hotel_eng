    "detail": "Sea two pool villa is an excellent choice for the wary traveler looking unwind in a secluded establishment. Since Pattaya's beach is not as attractive as it once was, the next best option is an all in one resort in Pattaya. Location-wise it is off the city centre and there are basically zero shops for food or shopping nearby (closest is about 10 minutes by car/motorbike, pattaya floating market). But what it makes up with is its facilities and amenities. With private dipping pool with jets, outdoor shower, spacious villa and the common facilities such as the gym, a restaurant, a bar area and a common pool, sea two pool villa is a great, budget-friendly getaway resort. One complain though other then its location (which you can easily make up by renting a vehicle or motorbike), is its service. The room cleaning services is slow in response even though we requested only for a change of towels without the need for room cleaning. Apart from that I think i can add a new weekend resort getaway to my list.",

To Western standard it is a comfortable medium firmness, certainly not soft but not rock hard like other hotels in Asia. The bathroom is quiet small but has plenty of room in the shower and bath area, its nice to see the shower separate of the bath and not requiring you to hop in and out of a bath tub for a shower. The toilet is a state of the art American Standard top of the range electronic toilet, has all the cool features of Japanese toilets and then some, such as a more western sized seat which is nice. Views from the balcony are awesome, on the south facing side you can see the entire Pattaya beach shoreline and pretty much the entire rest of the beach area. Definitely will be coming back soon as it's also an excellent location due to Terminal 21 being connected.",

    "detail": "On my conquest of travelling around the world, having visited Pattaya multiple times, this is the hotel that stands out, being a hotel that deserves recognition and writing a review for. If I could, I would rate it a 5 star hostel, not a 2.5 star like humbly mentioned. It really exceeds my expectation. I believe that everyone who visits Pattaya for the first time should visit, you will not regret it and will definitely come back to visit again. Trust me, I’ve been there. My experience: I came to this location through google maps, but the sign is easily noticeable and you will appreciate it as it is just next to a large department store in the area; Royal Garden - I find it very valuable for a small hostel to be so easy to navigate to in the busy streets, and the convience of being able to get everything just nearby. My friends and I usually have the problem where, early in the morning, the quality restaurants are not yet opened and the street food are believed to be unclean. This hostel is just above a McDonalds which is open for 24hrs, so it solved all our problem concerning food :) We came here late at night so we did not see the view of the sea that clearly, but in the morning, we saw the sun rise just above the sea and I find that an experience to share. It is a must see for everyone who comes to pattaya. Before I booked, I checked the relative prices of nearby hotels which is much more expensive for a single room, but the reason I chose this hostel is because it is newly opened, fingers crossed as I booked, turns out a choice worth the risk and unbelievably clean! Do you understand the feeling of a new hotel, where everything from the toilet seats are brand new, white and clean! This is exactly my experience. The attention to detail is all cared for, clean new beds and pillows! Last but not least, the Wi-Fi, so damn fast, so speedy. Almost no delay in streaming Euro 2016.",

    "detail": "I liked this hotel very much. For the money it is a great bargain. It's clean, in a great location, centrally located around Soi 13 half way between the madness at soi 5 and walking street. The room is high end because this is a newer property so it's modern looking. I didn't really like that it had a bath tub rather then a stand up shower but this is definitely not a negative. The fact that the show has no door also is a bit annoying but most places in Thailand seem to be the same. The one dowside to this hotel is the pool. I have no idea why but that stuck the pool on the 2nd or 3rd poor. It's sort of an indoor pool with about 10% of the pool outdoors in the sun and the the rest of the pool shaded. For this reason not many people use the pool which is nice, but the water is cold because most of the pool gets no sun. This is really the only negative I could find about this hotel. Everything else is wonderful and I would say it's one of the best boutique hotels in Pattaya for the money, about $65 USD.",
