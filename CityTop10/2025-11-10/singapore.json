    "detail": "Loved the design of this hotel, feels luxurious for its price and has little technological touches that make everything easier and get you into the Singapore vibe. The rooms are tiny but that’s very common in Singapore (as in many major cities around the world). Everything is very clean and designed to make the best out of the small space. The staff were very nice (and the robot who acts as room service was cool as well). I didn’t love the breakfast, not many options for plant-based eaters, but if you’re used to having eggs, meat and dairy in the morning you should be fine. The location is great - by a nice section of the river with many cafes, bars and restaurants. It is about 15 min walking distance from the nearest MRT station but the hotel also offers a free shuttle service to select locations in the city which makes it very easy to get around. All in all the hotel was great and we will definitely return to it next time we’re in Singapore. ",

    "detail": "Unique loft design, love the 2 storey high window! One of the value for money hotels in Singapore. Great location at Robertson Quay, which is only 5min walk along Singapore river to Clarke Quay. Clarke Quay is famous for bustling night life and many cafes and restaurants along the river! There are many nice cafes around the hotel, which serves delicious all day breakfast, hence breakfast at hotel may be skipped. Very comfortable loft bed in the Premier room. Bathroom and toilet are separate. Both are pretty cramp, just nice fit 1 person. Cleaniness can be improved as stains can be noted at the robes hanging area. The sofa on the lower level can be pulled out to be a sofa bed, hence can accommodate more than 2 persons in the room. The room is equipped with safety box, fridge, hairdryer and separate working table either on the upper or lower part of the deck. One thing to note is that public transport is not conveniently located near the hotel. For first time visitor to Singapore, it is advisable to travel around by taxi, which the hotel concierge staff can help to get.",

The rooms were clean, modern, and the beds were extremely comfortable. The location was great, and we were able to walk to many places. They also provide a free shuttle to the main areas in Singapore, which worked out great for us. For our few days at this hotel, we felt it really became our home. We generally don't use the fitness facilities at hotels, but felt like they really hit the mark with theirs, so took advantage of the pool/sauna/steam room. The pool and hot tub were also great, and most of the time we were able to enjoy them to ourselves. Any other guests we would run into were very friendly. We would definitely stay here again, especially since we found it so affordable compared to many other hotels in Singapore. Overall, great experience! ",

With 2 luggages open there won't be a place to stand also but guess that's common in all hotels in Singapore.

(the best staff we ever had in a hotel) They helped us with planning, adjusted for us the menu to our vegan twists, even cheak and printed for us information about an event in the city! *The location - Perfect location very close to ION mall and MRT station. we mostly used buses. it is nicer to see the city this way (bus stop is even closer and located in front of Thailand embassy) we also liked the hotel located on the beginning of Orchard street. it is very easy to take a bus to see all the street. Since it's a one way street you can get out each time in the stop you like. * The room - small as most rooms in Singapore hotels but designed very smart and functional! we felt like in a space-ship with cool view on the city skyline. * facilities - 10th floor is Amazing! the gym is very good and new! The restaurant is amazing with very good prices. We got a 50% discount for breakfast for choosing to eat only fruits and veges in the morning :) kitchen is open till 22:30 and we used to get nice evening vegan fruit and veges salad that was adjusted for us! Thank you so much for the warm hospitality. we relay appreciate every one of you! You are areal Pros! Best Regards, Daniel & Sarit ",

    "detail": "My family and I stayed at hotel boss for 4 days in a family room with balcony (good for 4 pax).Over all the hotel room is brand new since the hotel just started last year. Everything are still crisp. Staff are all nice, helpfull, accomodating and smiling. The location is great, there are 2 MRT stations near it (Bugis Statiob and Lavender Station) which is about 5 minutes away through walking and a bus stop just right outside the hotel door. Mustafa center and bugis shopping mall is near. There are also tourist attractions near the area like Haji Lane wall art and Mosques. There is a 24/7 fast food chain (food clique) within the hotel premises which I find convenient because you don't have to worry getting hungry after a long day walking around singapore. A money changer, convenient store, restaurants, winery, and souvenir shops are also in the premises. I just hope they would maintain its cleanliness and beauty. Our room is small though for a family of 4. Our big suitcases can't just be open all the time because it'll obstruct our walk way and there is no closet. And also you have to request for a Do not Disturb sign, sometimes they're running out of it. Room lighting is nice and the wall art at the bed frame is beautiful. The balcony is big and spacious. Bathroom is nice, and clean with amenities; no bidet spray though. Shower temperature is good. Room is complete with compact fridge, tv, safety box, water boiler, and compimentary coffee & tea. The bed is good, didn't feel any back pain and good fluffly soft pillows. Nice hotel amenities with their pool overlooking Singapore Flyer and the tip of Marina Bay Sands. Generally the Hotel is at great great location, brand new, best value for money, and comfortable place to stay. I would choose to stay at this hotel again once I'm back in singapore. I would rate this hotel 9/10 👏👏👏👍. My family had a great time and payment is hassle free thanks to agoda ☺️👍. Satisfied guest here! Great Job Hotel Boss! ",

    "name": "Carlton Hotel Singapore",
    "detail": "There are many 5 star hotels in Singapore and the Carlton is up there with the best yet, because it is an independent hotel, it manages to keep its prices very reasonable. There is a great happy hour at the bar a well-maintained pool and gym and the hotel restaurant manages to serve a huge buffet breakfast right through until 11.30am at weekends. The wi-Fi is super-fast and was included in our room rate. We were also upgraded to the premier wing which was nice although the standard wing is perfectly OK too. The only niggle is the car park. Its entrance design is very poor and awkward to reach the ticket machine at the entrance barrier as its on a sharp curve. But parking is free for guests so its only a minor niggle. Check-in and check-out is very efficient but beware the in-room capsule coffee machine. You will be charged for every capsule. ",

    "detail": "First stay at Dorsett Singapore but I have been to the lobby to pick up guests before. The staff service was impeccable as before. Service was good and friendly. The hotel is still new and very clean and comfortable. As with most Singapore hotels, the rooms are not as big as you would find in other countries but Dorsett has quite comfortable rooms for the prices. There was no bathtub but the shower was good. Another plus is the location, situated right on top of Outram MRT station provides easy access by subway and trains. It is also located right at the start of Chinatown and provides a good location to explore Chinatown while being far enough to be quiet. There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance from the hotel. Travel to other parts of Singapore is easy by the MRT subway just beneath the hotel. We did not have breakfast provided but it was not a problem as there are plenty of restaurants and fast food a short walk away. Overall, this hotel excels with the service, friendly and help staff, clean and comfortable rooms, centrally located with easy access to train service.",
