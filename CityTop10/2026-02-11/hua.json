    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

Love the breakfast and coffee, staffs at the restaurant were very nice. Two nights were too short, will come back and stay here in my future visit to Hua Hin. Beautiful place to stay, short walk to the beach and easy to get grab car to go anywhere in Hua Hin. Thank you very much to all the lovely staffs at Resort De Paskani for making my stay a memorable one.",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

We chose this hotel because it was next to a friends condo. Access to the beach is good and there is a great night market 400 m from the hotel. Best thing was that we were upgraded to a family room, so a little more space and bunk beds for our little guy which he made into an extra playing area. The pool isn't the greatest, but good enough to get wet. Will definitely stay here again. ",

The breakfast is fine and quite an extended choice for Thai breakfast options. AFAIK in low season they dont put bacon out and only semi warm fried eggs. If you want bacon and say an omelette then just ask and they will knock up fresh for you. Great large size swimming pool and always clean. Ample secure parking to the rear of hotel. Okay the hotel is not on the beach but its a 10 minute walk away with access points near the hilton hotel and a small street near to Market village shopping center, the latter being a far nicer part of the beach and more peaceful but you can still find food and drink there too. Also the Night Bazaar is about a 15 to 20 minute walk and there is a market right outside the hotel but closed on Tuesdays when I was there. Yes its an old hotel but they try hard and the staff are just great. For the price you pay via Agoda it is probably the best deal you can get for your money in Hua Hin.",

    "detail": "As titled this is a brand new hotel, there isn't a sign from the main street to this hotel. Basically its next to Hua Hin Hospital coming down from Hua Hin Town towards Cha-Am. There's no sign on Phetkasem Rd (note to manager of hotel), you only see it once you turn in to soi 10. Hotel is not on the beach or tourist area, its basically in the middle of the main road between Cha-Am - Hua Hin. So if you want to get to anywhere you better have a rental or other means of transportation. There were only 5-6 rooms occupied when I checked in. So its very nice and quite. You seem to own the whole hotel complex. For The room, the finishing is OK and not really a 4-star. For me its more 3 stars, and as other reviewers the AC is really LOUD and also cannot get up to speed in terms of cooling. So better leave the key on when leaving the room unless you want to come back to a sauna. Swimming pool is small so I did not even bother, but do book a room with the jacuzzi on the terrace. Very nice for a quick dip. Breakfast was not a buffet style, understandable due to the number of guests they are still just opened recently. But with that the cook your own plate of A.B.F which is aplenty and very nice and fresh, the cooking lady even came out to greet us and ask about the food, which to me is a very nice gesture. Recommend this hotel if you are on transit or short stay in Hua Hin and plan to look around town/beach thus not staying much in-room. Not recommended if you want to stay and enjoy hotel facilities and all. ",

    "detail": "The hotel is located in a good location, quite comfortable to go around if you have a car but a little hard if you don't. The parking lot is not enough for all guests during weekends, it would be much better if the hotel could provide more parking space. The room was very clean, spacious, and all needed amenities were there. The bath was a little small but the water stream was good, not to little or not too much. The air conditioner was new and the temperature was easy to adjust. The bed was great but we found the expanded wooden base where the mattress was put caused us hurt quite a lot. I mean my girlfriend accidentally hit it with her shins and feet many times. I even slipped when I stepped down the bed and touch that wooden base and hurt my back when I fell down and hit it very hard. Maybe we were careless though, I don't know. One more thing we think the hotel needs to improve is the wi-fi signal which were all poor no matter what channel we tried to connect. We didn't swim so we have no comment about the pool, but from what we could see, it was very dim and needed more lights in the night. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Checking in and out were quite fast. Overall, we think it's worth of money and we will stay here again if we go back to Hua Hin next time.",
