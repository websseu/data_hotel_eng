    "detail": "This hotel is AMAZING!!! I fell in love with the pictures at first, but once I arrived there I was in AWE. It’s brand new, (only been one month since opening) so everything is white, clean and beautiful. I initially chose the standard capsule cause it was so cheap, but my friend and I upgraded to the deluxe oceanfront capsule which was not that substantial of a price difference. It was amazing waking up to the beach view in the morning! The rooms are not that expensive either, especially the capsule rooms. When you check in, the friendly staff politely prompts you to take off your shoes before entering, it’s a no shoe zone indoors. They provide you with an electronic room key that gives you access to the elevator and your locker, which upon opening receive a nice care hotel package of pajamas, towels, tissues, a mini razor, and a small water bottle. It’s very modern which is nice. What really sold me was the karaoke system that’s in the lobby cafe area, it’s free to use as a hotel guest. The owner is super friendly and cool, he owns a very well known karaoke bar chain that is located in several areas in South Korea apparently. That’s why the karaoke sound system is such nice quality. I absolutely loved singing to songs overlooking the beach! I anticipate the karaoke being a popular thing amongst hotel guests in the busier summer months. The decor of this hotel is exceptional. Full window oceanfront views, squeaky clean white floors, gorgeous modern interior design is only a minor detail of this beautiful hotel. I loved being able to look at the beach waves while eating breakfast in the hotel cafe. The Room Rates are very reasonable for the quality, grace, and luxury of Gwanganli Hotel 1. It felt like paradise staying here. This hotel stay is a must if you ever visit Gwanganli beach in Busan!!!",

We took KTX to Busan so this hotel was perfect for us. And I love that hotel provide coin laundry that guest can use (however lack of English translation in that coin laundry room).",

    "detail": "We enjoyed our stay in Busan's Stanford Hotel. The hotel is located in between Nampo train station and Jalgachi train station. It is nearer to Nampo gantry in our opinion. We reached the hotel via airport bus from Gimhae airport (which was located directly opposite the hotel - Airport Limousine Bus and stop at Nampo-dong for 6,000won) and left Busan via train (exit 6 Nampo is less than 30secs from the hotel entrance. However, if you are lugging big luggages (like we were) and going to the Busan train station, I would advise a taxi to Busan station. The taxi fare from hotel to Busan train station was only 4,400 won whereas the train ticket fares for two pax were 2,800 won. With taxi, it also saves you the trouble of dragging your luggage in the train station - and that itself is substantial savings in terms of effort. The excellent location of the hotel allows for various travel options and I calculated that we've saved a lot in terms of transport costs. There is no lack of food options or amenities around the hotel. Behind the hotel is Jalgachi market where you can have your seafood fix. Across the road from the hotel is the BIFF square where there are dozens of streetfood carts and restaurants. We preferred the streetfood carts and just walking around. We found the hotdeok of Busan to be unique as it's stuffed with nuts and there are many vendors selling the Busan version just opposite the hotel. Also there are many many many shops at BIFF square - think of it as the myeondong of Busan. Hotel service was good as expected from a four star hotel. Amenities were plenty and restocked daily. Beds were very comfortable. We were very happy with the view from our room. We had the harbourview and it overlooked the Busan bridge and Busan Tower. It was gorgeous at night. ",

    "detail": "The location is superb, just across the road from Busan KTX Exit 1 where there are small eateries and 24 hrs convenience stores. At Level 1 of the hotel lobby, there are 2 washers & dryers (beside the toilets) which is a plus factor and there is drinks vending machine, water dispenser, ice dispenser and microwave. The 2 of us stayed in the twin bedroom at 20th floor for 3 nights. The hotel room and bathroom is small and we can only open our L-sized luggage on the bed, but everything we need is there and the room is clean. But when we want to request for additional pillows, we can only ask for maximum 1 extra pillow per room. And when we have some issues with the washer & dryer, we tried to approach the counter staff for help but they cannot offer any help or assistance at all, which is pretty disappointing. Overall, the experience is good, room is clean, really easy to reach both Busan KTX and Busan Station Line 1 metro subway (Tips: There's a lift in between exit 4 and 6 if you are too tired from climbing stairs). Staff needs to improve on service standard as they were pretty cold and nonchalant attitude towards us.",

    "detail": "Trust me, there won't be any hotel in Busan at this rate with these facilities and cleanness/comfortability. It's located 30 seconds away from the Busan Train Station as well as metro Line 1, very closed to city downtown Seo-myeon and Nam-po. Although little bit away from Gwang-an or Haeun-dae, very well known marine cities, it will take you less than 40 minutes by either metro or bus. Try exploring the other sides of Busan such as Yeong-do, Song-do, Dadae-po and it will still give you a big blast of Busan! Enjoy to the full :)",
