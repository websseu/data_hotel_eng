    "name": "Sunday Sea Two Pool Villa Pattaya",
    "detail": "Sea two pool villa is an excellent choice for the wary traveler looking unwind in a secluded establishment. Since Pattaya's beach is not as attractive as it once was, the next best option is an all in one resort in Pattaya. Location-wise it is off the city centre and there are basically zero shops for food or shopping nearby (closest is about 10 minutes by car/motorbike, pattaya floating market). But what it makes up with is its facilities and amenities. With private dipping pool with jets, outdoor shower, spacious villa and the common facilities such as the gym, a restaurant, a bar area and a common pool, sea two pool villa is a great, budget-friendly getaway resort. One complain though other then its location (which you can easily make up by renting a vehicle or motorbike), is its service. The room cleaning services is slow in response even though we requested only for a change of towels without the need for room cleaning. Apart from that I think i can add a new weekend resort getaway to my list.",

    "detail": "Newly opened hotel in North Pattaya since October 1st, 2020. The hotel is situated right before Amari hotel and within a short walking distance to Terminal 21 and the beach. We booked city view and had asked for a connecting room in which they then placed us on 14th floor room; overlooking Termninal 21 and some green area view which was good for us. Rooms were clean and well equipped with plenty of plugs and USB chargers. Amenities are Breeze, the same brand as Amari hotel. Fitness is opened 24 hours and located on 3rd floor of the building. It is one of our most impressive facilities as the room is big and has a full range of weight training equipment and machines. Swimming pool is also another stunning facility with perhaps 40-45 meter in length. They got kids' slider in the other pool too. Breakfast area is in EAT restaurant and it is huge. They also offer gluten free roll. We think, with a full capacity, this hotel should also be offering interesting breakfast lines. The Chill room offers board game, domino, cards, pool table, access to the Apple computer, etc. and also opens 24 hours. Parking is also good; indoor and plenty but not sure if with full capacity, it would be enough. Though the hotel has got outdoor spaces which should be fine. Overall for this trip, Ozo is in a good condition and offers reasonable prices and perfect facilities. ",

If I could, I would rate it a 5 star hostel, not a 2.5 star like humbly mentioned. It really exceeds my expectation. I believe that everyone who visits Pattaya for the first time should visit, you will not regret it and will definitely come back to visit again. Trust me, I’ve been there. My experience: I came to this location through google maps, but the sign is easily noticeable and you will appreciate it as it is just next to a large department store in the area; Royal Garden - I find it very valuable for a small hostel to be so easy to navigate to in the busy streets, and the convience of being able to get everything just nearby. My friends and I usually have the problem where, early in the morning, the quality restaurants are not yet opened and the street food are believed to be unclean. This hostel is just above a McDonalds which is open for 24hrs, so it solved all our problem concerning food :) We came here late at night so we did not see the view of the sea that clearly, but in the morning, we saw the sun rise just above the sea and I find that an experience to share. It is a must see for everyone who comes to pattaya. Before I booked, I checked the relative prices of nearby hotels which is much more expensive for a single room, but the reason I chose this hostel is because it is newly opened, fingers crossed as I booked, turns out a choice worth the risk and unbelievably clean! Do you understand the feeling of a new hotel, where everything from the toilet seats are brand new, white and clean! This is exactly my experience. The attention to detail is all cared for, clean new beds and pillows! Last but not least, the Wi-Fi, so damn fast, so speedy. Almost no delay in streaming Euro 2016.",

    "detail": "i visit pattaya twice a year and i have stayed at the top rated hotels. there is no hotel in pattaya that can compete with amari, it’s fabulous and the staff are so friendly and helpful. during our recent visit in july, we booked 2 rooms for 8 nights and for all nights we were upgraded to the ocean tower rooms, trust me, if amari has rooms which are more superior they will upgrade you. the food is great at the essence restaurant. there is also a 5* restaurant called mantra which belongs to amari. it has a variety of good food. amari has two swimming pools which are clean and have a cozy feeling to them. if you stay in amari, you can book a room in the garden wing or the ocean tower, so if you prefer to stay in a room with a thai nature feeling then stay in the garden wing, but if you prefer a room with a sea view then stay at the ocean tower. there are other great hotels in pattaya, but amari is the best as shops are nearby, the beach is right outside, there are great cheap first class restaurants nearby which belong to the hotel. also, there are great places within the hotel for children such as an activities centre especially designed for children from the age of 2- 12. furthermore, there is a business centre with free internet access and they also have a free dvd rental system. this is truly a magnificent place and the only other hotel i can think of which can compete is burj al arab in dubai. i will be back at this paradise resort in december!
