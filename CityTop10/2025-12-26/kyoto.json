    "detail": "First of all, I definitely would not rate this as a 4-star hotel. However, as a 3-star (like most other hotel websites do), I can defintiely give a 5-star rating. I only stayed here for one night when I took a day trip to Kyoto from Tokyo. The room is small (which is fairly standard in Japan) but I felt that they have put a lot of thought into the layout. Not an inch of space is wasted and everything is within reach. Even the TV gives you a lot of useful information such as whether it's crowded at the natural hotspring on rooftop or whether the restaurant is open. The staff is helpful but the command of English defintely varies. Some of them don't speak English at all but they will happily direct you to someone who does. They were all very helpful with my day trip planning and gave me some very honest advice about my very time-aggressive itinerary (and yes they turned out to be right). For the price I paid I think it's excellent value for the money with all the amenities they provide such as the hot spring and the amazing breakfast spread. Its close proximity to the Kyoto station makes this an excellent jump off point for all the sightseeing needs for Kyoto. I'll definitely stay here again next time I go to Kyoto. ",

The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat.

The single room is clean and tidy. No problem fitting two luggage in the room. I've got sound sleep every night.",

    "detail": "The APA Hotel in Kyoto was a good hotel in a great location. The CUBE is right next door for dining and shopping, and your Shinkansen is right there for departure as well. There's a Bic Camera adjacent, if you need electronics. A coin laundry is 15 minutes walk east, by the river. It is entirely possible to walk to Chion-in and Kiyomizu-dera from the hotel - I did it. It'll make you feel like a pilgrim. (Takes about 45 minutes to get there) Really, a great place to stay. It's comparable to the Granvia, but - not being in the station itself - much more affordable.",
