    "detail": "First of all, I definitely would not rate this as a 4-star hotel. However, as a 3-star (like most other hotel websites do), I can defintiely give a 5-star rating. I only stayed here for one night when I took a day trip to Kyoto from Tokyo. The room is small (which is fairly standard in Japan) but I felt that they have put a lot of thought into the layout. Not an inch of space is wasted and everything is within reach. Even the TV gives you a lot of useful information such as whether it's crowded at the natural hotspring on rooftop or whether the restaurant is open. The staff is helpful but the command of English defintely varies. Some of them don't speak English at all but they will happily direct you to someone who does. They were all very helpful with my day trip planning and gave me some very honest advice about my very time-aggressive itinerary (and yes they turned out to be right). For the price I paid I think it's excellent value for the money with all the amenities they provide such as the hot spring and the amazing breakfast spread. Its close proximity to the Kyoto station makes this an excellent jump off point for all the sightseeing needs for Kyoto. I'll definitely stay here again next time I go to Kyoto. ",

I arrived early and left my bags with them which were waiting for me in my room when I came back to check in after sightseeing. although it's in a beautiful area and located across the street from a train station I gave it a satisfactory on the location since the train line that runs to it isn't from Kyoto station. There is another station with a train running from Kyoto station but it's a long walk with heavy luggage so I recommend a taxi from that station or one directly from Kyoto station which is what I did but be warned it's a hefty taxi fare. Other than that the food and baths were wonderful! They have 5 private baths on a first come first serve basis (so be prepared to wait a bit if you want those unless you go earlier in the evening). There is also a free hot and cold drink bar along with ice cream in the evening and probiotic drinks in the morning, as well as a massage parlor for an additional fee of course but the massage was excellent!

    "detail": "Our 2nd time in Kyoto. Glad to have found this hotel. Living Lobby, a perfect place for a cup of coffee and creative work. Near to 2 different train stations, three 7-11 outlets with postcard printing machine, 4 different bus stops and countless bars, cafes and restaurants. Walking distance to 祇園 Gion and next to 先斗町 Ponto-chō. Baggage storage meanwhile waiting for the check-in and also check-out. The amazing team of staffs are friendly and very helpful. Our little boy has been feeling under the weather on the 4th day, the staff recommended a clinic nearby. Also during check-out, a taxi has been reserved a day earlier by the reception staff and was informed it would cost around ¥1500 to Kyoto Station. Taxi arrived on-time. Really hassle free, saved us a lot of time too and the cost exactly as been told earlier. For visitors, do consider to grab a taxi from/to Kyoto Station. We would surely return again. ",
