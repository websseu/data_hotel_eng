But it's clean (to me) and it has a private bath and shower. I can stay here for a 4 or 5 days for the price of one night in a small Singapore Chinatown hotel or for the same price as a low end youth hostel. Then again I like eating at the street restaurants with the local people. This is not a place for the people who need to see eye candy all around them.",

    "detail": "Best price you can get right in the middle of Johor Bahru City Center, ease of walking distance to the CIQ if you plan to travel to Singapore while nearby shopping center allows easy access to food and retail purchasing. One thing if you travel by car to this place, you need to pay parking per day/entry (RM6) via TnG card, but the hostel offers top-up value service. Accommodation wise they have clean comfy beds and every bed has a charging station and grooming mirror. Their common area is well equipped for both heavy or light cooking and storing your food. Shared baths have shower heaters feature and hair dryer. Longer term travelers have a lot of value gained for this price. Depending on which part of the building your bedroom located, mine L2B2 is located near to a noisy bar premise, so it is a little distracting when I am trying to sleep. It would have been solved with a sound-proof window. Staff are very friendly in guiding me around the place to familiarize with the area. ",

Shopping is just downstairs. Breakfast was good with many variety on offer & helpful staff. Guests can rest at the lounge while waiting for check-in (brilliant idea - wish more hotels can do this!) Only grouse was the parking. I checked in on a Sunday & the mall parking was full so had to drive up to the higher levels. Small thing & did not in anyway affect my stay here. I highly recommend KSL Resort to anyone wanting a good hotel in Johor Bahru.",

The rooms are spacious, bed are comfy, room facilities are well arranged, toiletries are sufficient. This hotel deserves more than a three stars rating. Location is extremely good. The hotel are surrounded by most of the favourite/popular shopping centres and hawkers in Johor Bahru. Such as the tebrau hawker and KSL shopping mall just behind, pelangi just up a little, and a night hawker selling really delicious local food just across the road. All these places are within walking distance. Breakfast spread are considered good and atas (for the price you paying) with Egg station. I greatly recommend this hotel to everyone. Looking forward to my next visit. CONS: Shower heater abit slow in heating up the water. I have to let the water run for 15 minutes before I could step in. TV channels abit bland with local channels. Can be improved by adding some Movie Channels like Fox or HBO or Thrill. ",
