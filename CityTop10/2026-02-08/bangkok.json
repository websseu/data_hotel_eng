    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

The staff of the Grand Howard Hotel was very welcoming. The hotelroom was big, clean and had all comfort you need. We had a corner room in the 17th floor and could enjoy a spectacular view of Bangkok because of the very big windows. My children especially enjoyed the big swimming pool in the 6th floor. Part of it is roofed (protected from the sun) so you can use it at all day times. But the most we loved the staff of the hotel. They gave us good advice about what to see in Bangkok and they gave us a warm welcome every time when we returned to the hotel. We felt like being home. Thanks a lot to the staff of the Grand Howard Hotel!",

The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

    "detail": "For those who have rated this hotel/serviced apartment complex as anything other than wonderful you are either on drugs or in urgent need of seeing a doctor. I have stayed at the Grande Centre Point (GCP) on four occasions now – total of 32 nights – and I remain convinced it is not just one of the best located (direct access to BTS, main Sukhumvit Road etc) hotels in Bangkok but the best value. Yes, it is not everybody’s budget but for those happy at $100/120 per night (there are days, but not many, when these prices are significantly more expensive) don’t waste your time looking elsewhere. If having shopping on your door step is a plus, then you have the brand new Terminal 21 shopping centre. And you if you want cheaper shopping then the extensive range of street stalls on Sukhumvit Road are just outside. If gym work is a chore to you, the hotel has tried to make it much easier with an extensive array of equipment (not some puny little room stuck somewhere in a corner as with so many hotels in the City) – all with built in tv monitors. If you like a swimming pool and sun deck that is not just a paddle pool with some under-investment in sun loungers, then again GCP wins. And this is before you discover that there is a very generous area given to crazy golf and tennis. What other hotel in the City gives you these facilities ? Many of the great restaurants of Bangkok are on the Sukhumvit stretch, so you have all these within easy walking or taxi (or BTS) distance from you. Terminal 21 itself has many good quality eateries. For the ‘night lovers’ you have Soi Cowboy 100 meters away. Finally if there was a criticism I had in early stays at GCP it was the staff were under-trained but management have obviously put some time and investment into this critical service. So yes I can understand why some people will argue the case for other hotels in Bangkok (there are after all some magnificent ones in the City), they tend they tend to be in a significantly more expensive",

Quiet location, but easy walk to shopping, nightlife, Saladaeng Station and beautiful Lumpini Park. You can get a free shuttle too. All staff were very attentive, helpful and delightful. When my adaptor caused a fuse to blow, repairmen arrived within a couple of minutes of reporting it to recception and it was fixed immediately .Buffet breakfast and lunch were great. Gym is well equipped. But the highlight for me was my deluxe room, which was very spacious and comfortable and had a kitchenette as well. I got an excellent deal, which made it extremely good value for money. I visited friends in a much pricier Bangkok hotel and came away feeling I had made the better choice. I will certainly recommend Siri Sathorn to other visitors to Bangkok.",
