    "detail": "My son and I both really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Weil. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever tried. ALL the Staff are nice and helpful and service at every level and dept are ALL excellent. The room is very comfortable and also on the 10th floor room we had the view of Ipoh surroundings is very nice, and esp the surrounding limestone hills / mountains. Another big asset is the hotel is connected to the Ipoh Parade Mall which has many kinds of good restaurants. Note that the hotel and most others fill up on weekends -- evidently filled up because of local foodie tourists coming to Ipoh, even foodies from Singapore. Ipoh till now has its excellent food (reputation) basically everywhere. Ipoh main lacking though is ease of transport. Going out of the hotel is quite easy but not going back. So Weil Hotel location is a plus too since it is so central and many places are within walking distance. We got a local 3G data card for our tablet and used that to navigate the streets. All in all I think Weil is likely the best hotel in Ipoh now. Weil is setting the bar now for real value and excellent comfort. And then of course is the everywhere food in Ipoh -- a main everyday pursuit for excellent taste and tummy happy time !! ",

But at the end the staff shift me to another new room at 319 and thanks god everything was fine after shift into new room so just forgive them. The next morning when I woke up I leave a msg at reception counter ask them to do house keeping when I wanna go out, unfortunately during the night time when I back to my room the situation still same like morning without any house keeping. I purposely went down to reception to feedback and that time have 2chinese guys at reception and I dunno their name just can firgure out are one fat, short with spec and another one is tall n thin.

The only thing missing is gym & pool facilities but if that is not your priority, M Roof is definitely the place to stay especially if room is the most important part of the stay.",

    "detail": "Growing up in Ipoh, my impression of mid-priced hotels in Ipoh was not a favourable one. This Lunar New Year, I chose to have a one-night's stay at French Hotel in Ipoh New Town after seeing pictures in Agoda. True to what I saw in pictures, the rooms were modernly furnished and quite clean. The king-sized bed was comfortable for my wife and I. The bathroom was above my expectations and there was even rain shower. I called the reception desk regarding the hot water being lukewarm and help was rendered quite fast and effective. The staff were generally very efficient in serving guests. It is located not too far off the famous dim sum, taufu fah, white coffee places. I will definitely recommend tourists to Ipoh to stay at French Hotel Ipoh.",
