    "detail": "we booked 2rooms and were a group of 4gurls. we took the deluxe room facing the sea. i have been to malacca many many times for the past 20yrs, at least once a year, and this is the best best best hotel ever!!! stepping in, the decor blew me off. one of the hotel guys overheard my friends and i wondering where the lifts were to get to our rooms.. n he showed us the way without us asking. opened the lift door for us! when we reached our rooms, omg! we were amazed there were 2 flat screen tvs n even a couch! the decor is superb! modern fittings.. great bed.. lovely bathroom with choice to have a rain bath... im very picky with bathrooms.. n this is just great! water heater was hot n good! u can dim the side lamps.. they even had the option to listen to music on the tv.. great! breakfast is also great by malacca standards! the best breakfast i ever had! the guy cooks omelettes fresh for u.. reminded me of my thailand hotel stays. food is great! try their nasi lemak n curry chicken!! service is impeccable! they cleared our breakfast plates as soon as we were done with it. excellent service! the location is fantastic as well! just a 10-15min walk to jonker street, a 1 min walk to mahkhota parade shopping centre and it is also directly linked to the dataran megamall by an airconditioned bridge. overall, it was fantastic!!! had our new year countdown in my room.. tv fireworks food drinks great company... best stay in malacca in my entire 20yrs travelling there. it would be great if we could open the windows so we can really smell the sea.. n the aircon doesnt seem to set to 18deg but remained at 25degree. guess its the setting. other than that, no flaws! will definitely come back n i strongly recommend ppl to stay here!!!!

Staff are friendly and relaxed, accommodating for late arrival 1am and late check out, happy to hold luggage. Room has everything you want, kettle, complimentary water, comfortable bed, TV. The bathroom is modern and clean however the shower shares same room as toilet, so that can make the floor wet. This dries quick however so didn't bother me too much. Really excelling location right next to jonker walk - so it's easy to just walk out the door, explore! ",

    "detail": "It took us a while to check in as it has a very small reception, probably as it did not have as many rooms. The guests before us had some deposit issues and the staff (trainee) was unable to handle very well. Although they had up to 2 other staff arrived to handle that issue, they completely ignored us until I insisted to be served and checked in. Rooms are truly spacious and luxuriously decorated but one of the rooms had bad smell emanating from the toilet. I wonder if it is becos hotel was converted from old shophouses. Anyhow, we are quite happy with the rooms so we didn't make an issue out of it. One of the rooms had a huge bed, bigger than a king-sized bed, comfortably sleeping 3-4 persons. Hotel was well located, most places was walking distances away n not too near crowded or noisy places. We walked everywhere to explore the heritage and historical sites. They served set breakfast and their restaurant faces the river, which was lovely to have a meal in the morning as it was very nice, charming and breezy and during the night for beer or wine. Staff are warm and friendly, just maybe not as well trained. Perhaps a professional Manager doing his rounds will help improve matters n straighten out their priorities. We love this hotel and if we ever return to Malacca, this with definitely be our choice stay. ",

The executive room was great, big enough for family of 3 but the room didn't have the floor mat for the toilet and my room had only the ironing board but not the iron so i had to borrow from other room. We got a free upgrade from Imperial to Heritage Deluxe. It was so spacious and was very thankful. However, we were told that there were no towels and the towels will be in by 8pm but when we were back from dinner, it was still not there. It was then sent to our rooms after prompting the reception desk. The staff that administered our reservation was kind and all smiles. When i requested for all 3 rooms to be at the same level, she was kind to look through her system to amend. Overall, we are happy with the services at the reception, the malls are just around the hotel, and Bandar Hilir was just a walk away. We will definitely come back to this hotel for our next visit to Malacca!",

I booked the Straits Suites and it was huge! downside was the balcony was locked and you are unable to get access, suspect they locked up due to safety issue. The place was just beside Hattan Square therefore it is quite centralised. Need to cut across a small dark alley from Hatten hotel to reach Straits. Felt quite unsafe walking through the alley. (Unless you drive around in Malacca) Carpark was easy to manoeuvre as compared to several other hotels. Friendly staffs, brighten up your stay in hotel. Did not provide most things in suite example : pots, bowls, eating utensils (So why you provide a stove to cook?) No hair dryer so beware ladies if you need 1. xD Feels more like you are at home, in a service apartment than a hotel. (Flooring is not those hotel carpet) I like. xD Thumbs up for the front desk ladies for the big smiles you gave me when checking in and out! I'm sorry I forget your name. ;( ",

    "detail": "Been queuing for more then 40mit to check in (I arrived hotel lobby at 3.50pm, 6.20pm to reach my room)while my turn to check in was informed one room has been upgrade to hotel tower so we stay separate tower with my parents (I booked residence tower). Over all my stay here for one night experience, my advise for you don't book residence tower as even is new hotel but the room no well maintain and the most important the lift, oh my god this is so horrible!!! I bet 10 customer out of 9.5 are complaining the same problem of the lift! 1) we waited lift just get to our room for more then 15mit , trust me is more then 15mit, there is 6 lift on 3A(reception floor) but only 4 lift can access to residence room and the lift no air-con can you imagine from 3A to level 20th floor(the highest 42 floor) the lift are full and need to stop at almost every floor the smell of sweat in lift so disgusting !空气不流通 2) My hubby call housekeeping ask to send toothbrush set Coz there is no provide in our room and we been wait for more then 40mit . hello is 40mit ,just to get toothbrush !!!! Terrible! I do went to my parents room which in hotel tower at level 11 floor ,the room maintenance and housekeeping/room services and the most important lift much better and faster we ask for extra pillow send to room just within 10mit, same hotel same management but service so much different. 3) on the second day before check out i took shower and wash my hair after all only realize there is no hair dyer at room my hubby call again to house keeping ask for it and still waited for 20mit just to send one hair dyer, really fed up of it My advise to Swiss garden malacca management : Your staff are friendly and good smiling enough, first thing to change is the residence lift must have a solution to solve the main problem and hire more staff. I Will only be back after have improvement otherwise no way, same price we can have many option and better hotel in malacca.",
