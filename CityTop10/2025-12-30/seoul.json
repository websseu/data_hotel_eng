    "detail": "I have been to Seoul more than 30 times and usually book this place because of its location. It is right in front of Itaewon station, very convenient in city center, good access from airport and easy to move around. The room is clean and has free and fast Wifi. They used to have Korean Sauna at B1F but now the size is smaller, I still enjoy it though. Their staff is there 24/7 and helpful, they speak English and Japanese too. Money exchange is also available at the reception. One comment I should make is the noise from the neighbors, since Itaewon is a night town in Seoul, there are many people at clubs, pubs, etc. around this hotel and it could be loud (even in the hotel room) especially Friday and Saturday night. Single travelers or young couple should be fine but it might be not suitable for the family with young children. Also in summer they have small swimming pool at 5F and many, many people from outside of the hotel visit, so the elevator could be crowded sometimes.",

    "detail": "It is my 6th time to be in South Korea but my first time to stay at Hotel Peyto Gingham. The experience is awesome, 10/10 I would say for the price given. I checked in the hotel at 12:30AM at midnight and the location of the hotel was easy to find even when it was all dark outside. The hotel staff was being very helpful and kind as they reminded me that the Zen Double room I booked do not provide real high beds. So they offered to let me have a look at both the Zen Double and Deluxe Double rooms first before choosing which one to stay at since my stay was for 7 nights. Both rooms are fine and look comfortable but I eventually chose the one closer to the elevator. The hotel is located at the main street: Gangnam-daero and is just 3 minutes away from Yangjae Station (Line 3, exit 2). Although it is in Gangnam, with line 3 it only takes one to get to the touristic or shopping areas in Gangbuk within 35 minutes (i.e. Eujilro station; Myeongdong; Jongno... etc). Everything inside the room was great and the room looked really like a compact yet comfortable studio flat, at the centre of Gangnam (Seocho-gu). I stayed in various hotels in Seoul before (Lotte Hotel in Euljiro; Skypark Central in Myeongdong; Classic 500 in Konkuk Uni and etc), but I'd rank Hotel Peyto Gangnam as my first priority given its excellent location, clean and modern room, helpful front desk staff members and the not-too touristic feel that area gives.

I carried plenty of luggages, so I took taxi from Seoul station, it took me just 5 mins to reach the hotel and cost me only 4500 won. Room: Excellent! Very clean, great comfortable bed and bathroom is superb. Room view is excellent, too. Service: Receptionists and concierge are very polite and welcoming. They speak very good english and also very efficient. The housekeeping lady is also very nice and warm. They take extraordinary effort to ensure our stay was a memorable one. Facilities: Love their library so much. Very well decorated with a great view of Seoul skyscraper buildings. Overall, I couldn't ask for a better experience during my stay in this hotel. They did a really good job to ensure everything was flawless. And I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seoul.",

    "name": "Royal Hotel Seoul",
    "detail": "I frequently travel to South Korea and ave stayed at a variety of hotels. The Royal hotel is an excellent choice for staying in Seoul. It is located in the heart of Myeong-Dong, the city centre of Seoul. The hotel can easily be reached from the airport with Airport bus 6015 (10,000 KRW or 11 USD - exit at Eulji-ro ipgu). The bus travel takes about 1 hr and tickets are available in the boots near the bus stops just outside the arrival teerminal. Staff speaks English and credit cards are accepted. Avoid bus 6001, which comes to Eulji-ro ipgu as well, but is more expensive and takes 30 minutes more. Traveling by airport limousine bus is by far the best way to get from the airport to hotels. The rooms in the hotel are small, but clean and fully equipped. I found the room comfortable and enjoyed my stay. There are two subway stations near on 2 different lines. It is easy to reach most part of the city quick. The level of English in Korea has increased since 6 years ago when I first traveled. Although Itaewon district is still to be considered the place where foreigners can easily find their way, I find that Myong-Dong has caught up and many Koreans can speak a bit English here too. Excellent hotel at reasonable price. Following western system of stars for hotels I'd say 3+ stars, close to 4-star hotel. ",
