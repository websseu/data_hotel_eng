    "detail": "Stayed only for one night but very staisfied. Booked 2 rooms with interconnecting door. Mainly due to room size which size is quite generous, each bathroom got bathtub and best location to explore Ipoh city. Also we got complimentary parking at lower floors. Tried the swimming pool and quite like it, not too big or too deep. Bfast is also not bad and hotel staffs were very helpful. Recommended to all. ",

    "detail": "My son and I both really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Weil. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever tried. ALL the Staff are nice and helpful and service at every level and dept are ALL excellent. The room is very comfortable and also on the 10th floor room we had the view of Ipoh surroundings is very nice, and esp the surrounding limestone hills / mountains. Another big asset is the hotel is connected to the Ipoh Parade Mall which has many kinds of good restaurants. Note that the hotel and most others fill up on weekends -- evidently filled up because of local foodie tourists coming to Ipoh, even foodies from Singapore. Ipoh till now has its excellent food (reputation) basically everywhere. Ipoh main lacking though is ease of transport. Going out of the hotel is quite easy but not going back. So Weil Hotel location is a plus too since it is so central and many places are within walking distance. We got a local 3G data card for our tablet and used that to navigate the streets. All in all I think Weil is likely the best hotel in Ipoh now. Weil is setting the bar now for real value and excellent comfort. And then of course is the everywhere food in Ipoh -- a main everyday pursuit for excellent taste and tummy happy time !! ",

    "name": "MH Hotels Ipoh",
    "detail": "This may be a smallish 3-star hotel (without a swimming pool, gym & other facilities normally associated with higher end hotels & resorts), but it is definitely new (established in 2011) and clean. My family and I made a recent trip to Ipoh and had a good 2 night-stay at MH. Pleasantly surprised. We got the Family Room for RM350 per nite (RM390 for weekends and peak). May not be the best in terms of value, but it was spacious enough with 1 Queen and 1 Single Beds. We added an extra bed to cater for a total of 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids). Service was good - efficient and friendly staff. Located next to McDs and many other eateries, 2-3 minutes drive to AEON (Jusco) mall and just next to the entrance into Ipoh from the PLUS Highway. So, for me, I consider this to be location friendly. I have not stayed in other hotels in Ipoh, but I would certainly consider MH on my next visit to Ipoh.",

    "name": "Sarang Paloh Heritage Stay and Event Hall",
    "detail": "Ipoh town is famous for its food and the Sarong Paloh is the perfect place to stay in Ipoh for indulging and savoring some of the best eating places Ipoh has to offer. All within walking distance. I am not all that familiar with Ipoh town and I picked this hotel because of its high rating and its reasonable pricing. However, my family and I were pleasantly surprised that when it comes to food, many of Ipoh's famous eating outlets are just a stone throw away including favorites like Lou Wong Chicken Rice and Nam Heong Coffee Shop. Parking can be an issue during weekends and holiday season so it is a huge plus to be able to just leave the car at the hotel car park and just take a stroll. The hotel itself is a renovated heritage building and the owners have taken a lot of care to retain its original architecture and structure. We stayed in the Kingfisher room which is a loft style room with a nook under the stairs which my son absolutely adored. The renovation and decor serves to bring guests back in time. Modern amenities like a modern and well equipped bathroom are well hidden but readily available for the comfort of guests. There are no restaurants within the premise but just right next to the hotel is a restaurant that is also owned by the same owners as the hotel. With so much that Ipoh has to offer, we did not try out the restaurant but it does look very inviting. Guests are entitled to a discount at the restaurant. The hotel staff are very friendly and took a lot of time to share with my family on where to eat including places that are privy to the locals. ",
