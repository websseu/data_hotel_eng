    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

Love the breakfast and coffee, staffs at the restaurant were very nice. Two nights were too short, will come back and stay here in my future visit to Hua Hin. Beautiful place to stay, short walk to the beach and easy to get grab car to go anywhere in Hua Hin. Thank you very much to all the lovely staffs at Resort De Paskani for making my stay a memorable one.",

In the room, there were lots of plugs for charging devices, plus robes & slippers, and the wifi was fast. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless. The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

Best thing was that we were upgraded to a family room, so a little more space and bunk beds for our little guy which he made into an extra playing area. The pool isn't the greatest, but good enough to get wet. Will definitely stay here again. ",

Just a few steps to Family Mart, a few minutes to Hua Hin Night Market and restaurants for food. Staffs are very friendly and soft spoken. You may hire Private cars to your desired attractions through the hotel too.The swimming pool was nice as well. And yes, the Sky Bar on the rooftop was a very relaxing if you want to grab some air.

    "name": "Season Palace Hua Hin",
    "detail": "As we were having a weeks vacation with the family, travelling from Phuket to Chiang Mai and back I chose hotels that had the facility of a swimming pool. Unfortunately the Season Palace Hua Hin were having staff problems in keeping their pool clean. (or maybe a filter problem). Either way the pool was absolutely filthy! And that's coming from someone who has had and maintained a pool for over 25 years. The water was not only murky, which can happen, but it was brown murky, which was dirty water. The 3 b't put a toe in water that was that dirty. Sorry, I am aware that it is the low season in Thailand and all hotels are struggling to stay in business, but there really is no excuse for not keeping a pool clean. All it requires is to backflush the filter regularly and add the appropriate amount of chemicals, if not a salt water pool, which this wasn't. We were also unaware that the restaurant was closed in the evening. Which turned out to be a blessing as it forced us to go into Hua Hin to one of the many great restaurants and have a nice dinner and evening. ",

    "detail": "We stayed here during the long weekend (Mother's Day in Thailand). We are lucky to get a very good deal from Agoda because hotels in Hua Hin is quite expensive. We booked since 17Jul13 and check in on 10Aug13. Recommend everyone to stay here because this hotel is clean, safe, staffs are friendly and there are swimming pools right next to the beach. Also Cecada Market is in walking distance (5 minutes walk only). We will go back there again if we go to Hua Hin.",

    "detail": "As titled this is a brand new hotel, there isn't a sign from the main street to this hotel. Basically its next to Hua Hin Hospital coming down from Hua Hin Town towards Cha-Am. There's no sign on Phetkasem Rd (note to manager of hotel), you only see it once you turn in to soi 10. Hotel is not on the beach or tourist area, its basically in the middle of the main road between Cha-Am - Hua Hin. So if you want to get to anywhere you better have a rental or other means of transportation. There were only 5-6 rooms occupied when I checked in. So its very nice and quite. You seem to own the whole hotel complex. For The room, the finishing is OK and not really a 4-star. For me its more 3 stars, and as other reviewers the AC is really LOUD and also cannot get up to speed in terms of cooling. So better leave the key on when leaving the room unless you want to come back to a sauna. Swimming pool is small so I did not even bother, but do book a room with the jacuzzi on the terrace. Very nice for a quick dip. Breakfast was not a buffet style, understandable due to the number of guests they are still just opened recently. But with that the cook your own plate of A.B.F which is aplenty and very nice and fresh, the cooking lady even came out to greet us and ask about the food, which to me is a very nice gesture. Recommend this hotel if you are on transit or short stay in Hua Hin and plan to look around town/beach thus not staying much in-room. Not recommended if you want to stay and enjoy hotel facilities and all. ",
