    "detail": "we reach macau after 6 days stay in hong kong and travel to macau for another 3 days holiday. we reach macau ferry terminal and easily we are able to see a lady standing at the exit of the ferry terminal showing venetian macao resort hotel and directed us to the free shuttle service. before taking the free shuttle, i had tried to queue up at the macau ferry when i arrived for the purchase of ticket (turbo jet) back to hk, and end up, after half hours, the queue is still non moving. so,i back to the hotel, and through their great concierge service. we are able to book our ferry ticket (cotai jet) back to hk in advance without any hassle. once we reach the hotel, we are welcome and directed to the check in at the south lobby. we are expecting that it will be a slow process or long queue, due to these hotel having 3000 rooms! however, we are surprise of check in within 5 minutes, and was being shown to our hotel room. we are even being offered 2 welcome drink & 1 free 4r photo! our requisition of baby cot & high floor is being meet as well. we shops inside the hotel itself, and we walk till drop coz of the great varieties, though the shops price is a bit higher than outside. we did join the half day tour around macau and at affordable rate at mop98/ppl. its surprised that with mop98/ppl, we are able to see 15 highlight place of macau. a great tour to join! during our check-out, we did keep our luggage at the baggage center and when we did a claim at our baggages, the staffs offer to help us trolley our baggage to the free shuttle waiting for us to cotai ferry terminal. if i were to come to macau again, i will definitely stay in the venetian macao resort hotel and will recommend my friends to there too... p/s : the next time, i will visit the casino, and i had missed it this time due to time constraint on shopping! :) ",

    "detail": "Sheraton Macau was a surprise to me. I am the type who reads hotel reviews first before I book. I chose the Club King with Lounge access because buffet breakfast is included (just being practical). Fortunately, it also comes with an afternoon snacks and evening cocktail which for me is a big big plus. When we entered the lounge, we were greeted and attended to immediately by one of the hotel staffs (great job Alfie Rocamora). Staff like him is an asset to the company, very efficient so our check in was fast. Everything was explained, he knows what the guests need to know. We were able to check in at 130pm and was allowed to check out 1pm the following day (i have never experienced this with other 5 star hotels in Macau...only with Sheraton). We were also upgraded to a Cotai View room (what more can you ask for?). The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was really nice. Outdoor pools are beautiful but the weather wasn't good at that time. Temperature was still cold (19degrees) so we were not really able to enjoy, we just took pictures of the surroundings. I highly recommend this for the quality of the hotel and staff performance as well as the value for money. Overall, it was an excellent stay!",

My personal share view about Macau is: Macau is a Chinese and Spanish culture city, especially old local building, historical building, Old Roman Catholic church, old Chinese temple, entry ticket is very cheap (MOP 10) to see Panda in Macau City unlike in China the entry ticket is RMB100 and above, plus most of the tourism places in Macau city does not need entry ticket including museum. Food in Macau is nice and only McDonald available in Macau city, and no KFC in Macau. Regarding gambling places, most of these places are free entry, beautiful and elegant designed, especially The Venetian is the best and worth to visit in evening 5PM. Chinese people in Macau is very nice, helpful, and civilize, but if you are able to speak cantonese to them, they are even willingly and helpful to you. Merely bus in Macau not really covenience sometimes although is cheap, easily get confuse, and taxi in Macau is espensive. Macau City is a nice place to visit although its small.",

Studio City is a legitimate resort, with plenty of restaurants, amenities and fun things for the whole family. For kids there is the Batman Dark Flight simulator ride which is the best 4D ride i've ever been on. There's a WB Fun Zone which is a giant kids play area, comprising of multiple floors and can keep kids entertained for hours while you are enjoying the casino. Or can spend time with the kids. The giant pools with water slides, hot jacuzzis and a lazy river cant melt away the afternoon. In the middle of the hotel is the Golden Reel, a built-in ferris wheel attraction. Lots of places to eat. with the only complaint being that room service stops at 10:30pm. The room is very nice. There are two towers, the star tower and the celebrity tower. We stayed in the celebrity tower which seemed to be the less exclusive of the two. But it was easily a 3-4 star room. Has everything, great view and spacious. The hotel can be seen from the airport and is near the Venetian. It's a $50 Macau dollar taxi ride from the hotel to the airport. Overall completely recommend Studio City Hotel for any stay in Macau. You won't have to leave the resort at all unless you want to.",

Rooms are antic and beautifully designed. The shower booth and bath are perfect and all the soaps are Loccitant products.

    "detail": "Actually, the hotel is in the middle of everything. The hotel is very close to Ferry station, and around the hotel there are plenty of restaurants, 24h supermarkets, and in the really next door to tree lamp quarter where u can buy original clothing designer in macau. Hotel is a bit worn, hence, room and air condition system could be renewed. But the room is kept clean. Sofar depends on the price one pay, it is worth the money staying there. While I have read that most staffs could not speak english, but I just have experience the opposite site. Every times, I was talking with staffs at check in counter. They can speak english.",

Rose escorted us to the room, she told us all the hotel facilities and room amenities. Brian from the Concierge helped us with our luggage and provided some information in Macau. He also waited for us near the recreation to escort us to go to the lounge on eight. Lyn from the lounge on eight is very nice and engaging, the overall experience in the lounge on eight which is already very good is greatly enhanced because of her costumer engagement. Upon going out. Jury helped us on where to go, he gave us detailed information on which place to visit and which is very good place to go as my mom is having difficulty on walking.

Hotel provides shuttle bus to ferry station & you can actually take other interchange shuttle buses provided by other Casino Hotels to around Macau. Hotel has indoor swimming pool & a little casino as well. Price is very reasonable when you compared to other 5 star hotel in Macau. Public transport is 6 MOP /pax per trip no matter the distance (1st or last stop). Thanks Roy for the free upgrade to Deluxe room. Will come back again. ",
