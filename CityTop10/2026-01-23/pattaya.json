    "name": "Sunday Sea Two Pool Villa Pattaya",
    "detail": "Sea two pool villa is an excellent choice for the wary traveler looking unwind in a secluded establishment. Since Pattaya's beach is not as attractive as it once was, the next best option is an all in one resort in Pattaya. Location-wise it is off the city centre and there are basically zero shops for food or shopping nearby (closest is about 10 minutes by car/motorbike, pattaya floating market). But what it makes up with is its facilities and amenities. With private dipping pool with jets, outdoor shower, spacious villa and the common facilities such as the gym, a restaurant, a bar area and a common pool, sea two pool villa is a great, budget-friendly getaway resort. One complain though other then its location (which you can easily make up by renting a vehicle or motorbike), is its service. The room cleaning services is slow in response even though we requested only for a change of towels without the need for room cleaning. Apart from that I think i can add a new weekend resort getaway to my list.",

All the basics, and anything extra--such as more towels or changing the sheets, costs more. Location is North Pattaya, the opposite end of Pattaya from Walking Street. If you want to be around Walking Street, choose another hotel. If you want a quieter location, but still convenient to the beach, this is an ideal location. ",

    "detail": "On my conquest of travelling around the world, having visited Pattaya multiple times, this is the hotel that stands out, being a hotel that deserves recognition and writing a review for. If I could, I would rate it a 5 star hostel, not a 2.5 star like humbly mentioned. It really exceeds my expectation. I believe that everyone who visits Pattaya for the first time should visit, you will not regret it and will definitely come back to visit again. Trust me, I’ve been there. My experience: I came to this location through google maps, but the sign is easily noticeable and you will appreciate it as it is just next to a large department store in the area; Royal Garden - I find it very valuable for a small hostel to be so easy to navigate to in the busy streets, and the convience of being able to get everything just nearby. My friends and I usually have the problem where, early in the morning, the quality restaurants are not yet opened and the street food are believed to be unclean. This hostel is just above a McDonalds which is open for 24hrs, so it solved all our problem concerning food :) We came here late at night so we did not see the view of the sea that clearly, but in the morning, we saw the sun rise just above the sea and I find that an experience to share. It is a must see for everyone who comes to pattaya. Before I booked, I checked the relative prices of nearby hotels which is much more expensive for a single room, but the reason I chose this hostel is because it is newly opened, fingers crossed as I booked, turns out a choice worth the risk and unbelievably clean! Do you understand the feeling of a new hotel, where everything from the toilet seats are brand new, white and clean! This is exactly my experience. The attention to detail is all cared for, clean new beds and pillows! Last but not least, the Wi-Fi, so damn fast, so speedy. Almost no delay in streaming Euro 2016.",

    "detail": "My stay was actually very good. The rooms are amazing and most importantly.... they are clean!!!! I stayed in the deluxe room and it is very spacious. The decor is simply stunning and most importantly, the beds at this hotel are actually soft!! 90% of beds in Pattaya are like bricks so this was a great surprise. If staying here I wouldn't recommend the standard room only because the toilet is shared with the shower so it seems really weird to me. Plus the standard is very very small. The only 3 complaints that I have is that the internet is some of the worst and slowest I've experienced in Thailand. Its almost unusable. There is hardly any room between the toilet and shower. The toilets are shoved up too close making it very difficult to be comfortable while sitting down. I actually had to sit sideways lol. Lastly, the showers have both a rainfall shower head and also a handheld shower head. For some reason hot water would come out of the rainfall head but would not come out of the handheld one. Aside from that, this hotel has the friendliest staff I have ever had the pleasure of being around. Ive stayed at a lot of hotels in Pattaya including the epic Centara Grand Mirage and this hotel just kills the competition on staff friendliness. Is this hotel worth staying at?? Definitely!!. There are very few hotels in Pattaya that offer a perfect experience. Most don't have good internet, most have hot water issues, most only look clean on the outside, etc etc. So yes, I would stay here again.",
