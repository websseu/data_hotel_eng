    "detail": "Weâ€™d stayed in IFC Residence from July 25 to August 21. We have to say it is definitely the best apartment hotel in Shanghai, with respect to the location, the staff and the elegant facilities provided. Starting from check-in, you were welcomed by friendly and efficient reception staff. During our stay, whether it was for calling a taxi or for some sightseeing tips, the reception or concierge team was always ready to give help! To name a few, thank you Helen, Michelle, Alice and Kiki... thank you Jami and Frank... in general, the whole team is worthy to be complimented! What makes it outstanding is the fact, besides the elegant hotel as it is; you are always greeted & served with friendly smiling staff! A Big Bravo to Yvonne, the newly landed manager from Hotel Ritz Calton Shanghai, who has obviously brought with her the elegant customer service concept to her team in IFC Residence. The other best point is location, which is unique in Lujiazhui. Simply by opening the hotel door, an excellent mall is in front of you, where you could find various choices of the restaurant, or the access to the subway, etc... With respect to the breakfast, the choice is basic. However, the restaurant manager Leo is always there listening to your need; Service girl Coco would bring a cup of coffee with two sugar bags to me whenever seeing me come to breakfast. A wonderful personal touch! We had a wonderful time in Shanghai, due to all the convenience provided by IFC Residence and its team! We will certainly recommend it to friends and those who would like to explore Shanghai starting from Pudong! ",

A good omen for the hot summer in July. We like the Ole supermarket and also the One in the basement of City Plaza ( opposite to Jing An temple). Good places to buy Chinese and import grocery. - hotel: clean standard room. Friendly/helpful staff/prompt service from Ms Rachel/IT support 24 hrs service/Laura from Housekeeping/Albert from the concierge whichis fully attended for any queries. - room service: exhausted from the heat and walking all over in Xintiandi and Tanzifang, we decided on room service and totally enjoyed the xiu long bao and Hainan chicken as well as the Chinese breakfast which is quite generous for one person to finish.

I would recommend all guest to have a drink at the Vue bar to chill out. Being situated at Pu xi, Huang Pu Road the hotel is minutes walk from the Bund and nan jing road where most of the great, shopping, restaurant and bar located at. Very convenient location. As for the facility, Hyatt on the Bund provide better facility than other 5 star hotel in city. warm pool and great gym.

    "detail": "We have stayed at many Jin Jiang hotels in China, but this was our first time staying at the flagship hotel in Shanghai. We were very impressed with the quality, cleanliness, and professionalism of the staff. Booking through agoda gave us the opportunity we probably wouldn't have otherwise had to stay at this 5-star hotel because of the great value offered. Interesting to note that many famous people have stayed there previously, including Reagan, Thatcher, and Deng Xiao Ping. It was also very convenient to Metro's line 1 and within walking distance to many stops and restaurants. The staff was always very helpful in calling a taxi for us when necessary, however. The only slight negative was the fact that there are many entrances on the Jin Jiang site which can become a little confusing to new guests and taxi drivers; however, the staff was always available to guide and deliver us where we needed to go. We would definitely stay there again in the future - with agoda's help, of course!",

    "detail": "I booked the hotel for my family and friends on their way to my wedding in China. Despite a lot of confusion over the bookings, and a mistake on the part of the hotel, they were very accommodating and solved the problem quickly. The art deco design of the hotel is interesting and historic, and the rooms were larger than I expected given it's central location. They didn't have breakfast included in our bookings, which was disappointing, but they are extremely convenient to street breakfast, Starbucks, and other nicer places to eat (for other meals as well). Their convenient location to Line 2 made for an easy transition between Pudong airport, Hongqiao airport/train station, and Shanghai Railway station, as well as easy access to sites and nightlife on Line 1, and minimal taxi rides to other locations. It's also a comfortable and enjoyable walk to the Bund. All-in-all, I think this hotel, booked at about 100 USD per room (both twin/double were more or less the same price), was well worth the price based on it's great service, fantastic location, and comfortable accommodations.",
