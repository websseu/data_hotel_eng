    "detail": "Our stay was awesome! So much so that we went to Phi Phi for a few nights, then skipped Krabi town and came back here! The pool is a little small and crowded, the check in staff can be a little slow and the eggs lady at breakfast was pretty clueless but apart from that I totally loved it here. One thing their website doesn't say is that while it's in Krabi it's only accessible by boat. We drove, and had a hard time finding the office to park our car at but we found it in the end near the jetty. Our car was safe for a period of 5 nights and parking was free. The boat ride over was cheap, but pack light because lugging a suitcase from boat to boat wears thin! When you're at Realeigh Beach Krabi (the beach this hotel is on) make sure you walk around and check out the whole area - east and west side. Tip: get up early, the beach was deserted until about 8am (so too was the breakfast buffet). Meals in the restaurant were super tasty, much more expensive than other areas but generous serves and really tasty. The hotel has an activities centre that organises great day trips - make sure you pop in there to do a day trip. A day trip to all the islands was great fun - Chicken Island etc. The boat that the hotel organised was by far the best boat out on the water that day, so while it might be a tad more expensive it was worth it. We left our wallets, keys etc on the boat and they were well looked after by the staff. They also did a head count each time we got out to swim so safety was important to them - definitely recommend doing this through the hotel. Walking Street is right next door, although pretty small so don't expect much. I'll be skipping Krabi town next time I'm in the area and heading straight here. Best hotel in Krabi I think! ",

When deciding on a Krabi hotel, I wanted a decent sized resort in a central location, that was right on the beach. Krabi Resort ticked all those boxes. When I arrived, I quickly determined that I had picked the optimal resort for the area as Krabi resort was the most centrally located, and one of only a very few that had direct access to the beach. The reason is the resort is one of the originals for the area, but the over the years it has expanded a lot, meaning you can choose between a lot of accommodation options, eg hotel style rooms, or semi detached rooms, to fully detached villas with their own private pool. The resort itself is large and they drive you to your room after you check in. Facilities include two pool areas (one done like a pirate ship), a fantastic gym, large scale chess board with pieces set up, multiple restaurants, mini golf, bicycles for rent, beach, massage etc.",

    "detail": "Cliff Beach is a really good value for the money. By Western standards it would be a 3-4 star hotel. In Krabi it was really helpful to stay at this kind of place because the staff was very willing to help out with booking the various kinds of trips that travelers come to Ao Nang to take. These are generally booked through an agency anyway (who charters their own boat in Thailand?) so why not have it at a convenient location you can get to by just rolling out of bed? The weather was unpredictable when we were there so it was nice to have a comfortable, DRY! home base that we could retreat to. They also make sure that there are always fresh bottles of water in your room. How sweet. Definitely try the drinks but avoid the creepy in-house Activity Director/Muay Thai instructor.",

    "detail": "Writing this my the roof top pool, looking out at the sea. Don't really write reviews but after a bad start in thailand and this place been a slice of luxury, I felt I owe it to others to write a review. I had a bad start in a hotel a few hotels down, which was not clean and small pool, I then moved to the princeas for only £6 more and it is like a different world. Cold towel and juice on arrival, friendly staff and a bell not to carry your bags. Big room, lovely clean modern bathroom, balcony and free water tea and coffee. 2 swimming pools, one on the roof, free towels, pool side service,mini mart and beautiful restaurant, massive buffet breakfast and free wifi in all areas of the hotel. The staff are really friendly and helpful. On the east side so a short safe walk to the more busy bars and then 10 min walk to the west and sunset beach. Lots of places to eat cheaply and well near buy and lots of places to book tours, found last bar the best and cheapest prices for this. Love this hotel and can't recommend enough !! ",
