    "detail": "Boracay is definitely a great place for a short honeymoon, or a beach holiday. The people are all super friendly and both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

    "detail": "My family had a splendid vacation at Fairways! Fairways has the best spot in Boracay Island. It has vast estate that houses a number of villas, pools and restaurants and a golf course. It has efficient and prompt shuttle services. We did not have to wait for a long time for the shuttles to arrive. Fairways has many of shuttles that are one call away. The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",

    "detail": "The staff was amazing and friendly. The room was modern and clean. The shower was really nice and had a tub as well. My bathroom had a weird smell that came from the sink, but that could be due to the recent typhoons and construction as well as typical plumbing that is often found in the Philippines. But I was really really pleased with my stay. We all had a great time and there was plenty of room for all 5 of us.",
