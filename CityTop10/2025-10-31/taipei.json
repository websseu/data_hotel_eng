    "detail": "This being my 9th trip to Taiwan, I have stayed at a number of hotels from 5 star to 3 star. I would rank this as one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Taipei. I had orgininally booked for 3 days but ended up staying a total of 6 days. The location in excellent with the Ximen MRT station exit 5 just outside the hotel. The rooms are very modern and the bed is very comfortable. This is a new hotel and there are still some renovaitons in the lower level but nothing to be a hinderence at all to your stay. I have only some very small comments to make but once again nothing to be overly concerned by. The lip on the shower floor is quite low so the water does not drain away as quick so need to be careful of the water flowing over to the floor. While ther rooms are very spacious there is no where to put your luggage except on the floor maybe the room could have a stand that you can put your luggage on. The breakfast is delivered to your room from an external supplier. Not really to my liking as it was cold. I would have preffered maybe some pastries than the american style that was delivered.. My final comment and this is not a critisicm of this hotel but of most in taiwan. I would like to see an iron and ironing board in the rooms. Overall I must say I was very impressed with this hotel and the staff. I will definately be booking this hotel again on my next trip.",

As you may notice, a lot of the Taipei hotels do not have windows in their room yet this one you can enjoy a great view of the busy Taipei. Besides, they have an iPad that allows you to control everything in the room with an app. Though you don't see the usual smart/butt-washing toilet but you get the smart lighting in your shower area in return. All in all, it's a nicely designed hotel which is also a good value for money. An obvious choice in the Taipei Station area.",

Upon collection of the access card to the rooms, these little envelope consists of the route map around the area for your easy preference, 2 access cards and the paper note for the access to free wifi. _Second, the place is only a 10min walk to Rao He night markets which are easily located. Upon that,there are 3 MRT stations located within the radius of the suites. The nearest MRT station with 7min walk is the Nanjing San Min station which is easily allowed you to travel over to Shi Lin, Xi Men night markets and Long Shan temple. This MRT station is 1 stop away from Taipei Arena. (Taipei Xiao Ju Dan) _The Con to the suites is located at the main road near the huge cross junction. The shelter did not extend to the road side and upon alight from your transport, you might get soak in the heavy rain. Overall, brilliant and recommended.",

If you are a late-night kind of person, you will like it here - right down the street you could easily find convenience stores as well as 24hrs MOS Burger! If you are into local street food, there are also 24hrs hawkers to fulfil your midnight cravings. As for the service, very friendly and helpful front desk staffs. Interior design is one of a kind - modern and pleasant. As it is still new, everything is in order, and most importantly, clean. I hope that the cleanliness could be maintained even when the facilities get older. Only thing is that it is a little pricey (but hotels in Taipei are generally on the expensive side), and that there are no windows in the room. ",

The breakfast buffet was adequate, but not spectacular. Overall I would highly recommend the Cosmos, and will surely stay there again when in Taipei. ",

Hotel is at the more expensive end of the range of Taipei hotels but I felt I achieved decent value for money all considering. Room for a couple was perfectly adequate, though did not appear as large as some photos I had seen in advertising. However this might have been due to the enormous bathroom taking a fair amount of the room space. I would neither describe the room as dated or modern, somewhere in between, but comfortable and always clean. Air conditioning was very good and quiet in operation. Breakfast was buffet style and comprehensive; I was very happy with it, the fruit juices were some of the best I have tasted. Staff need a special mention as they were consistently delightful, polite, friendly and always helpful (they could speak English though my partner can speak Chinese). Overall a very pleasant 8 day stay and I would visit again.",

A hospital and traditional market were also within walking distance. We chose this hotel because we had to take High-Speed Rail down to central Taiwan. After several hotel nights in Taiwan and Japan, kids unanimously voted Taipei Garden Hotel was the best! They want to stay here next visit.",

    "detail": "The location of the hotel nearby Starbucks, 7-Eleven, breakfast stores. It will take around 5 mins walk to the nearest MRT station. There's also night market with around 2 mins walk. The hotel is beautiful hotel with a heavy touch of Japanese culture. The reception staffs are friendly. We have a little issue with our booking since we change the date. Apparently there are 2 City Suites Hotel in Taipei city. One in the East and the other one in the West. We booked at the West branch. Before we change our date of stay, we made a call to the East branch to ask information about our date of stay and they said that we made a booking for the West branch. Yet, since we booked from Agoda, they informed us to change our date of stay from Agoda, so we did. Afterward, we came directly to the West branch. When we arrived, the staffs told us that our booking was made to the East branch. We were confused because the only thing that we changed from our booking was one the date of stay. After we showed the staff our booking both before the date change and after, the staffs help us clarified our booking. So we stayed at the West branch, which were the one that we initially booked. They upgraded our room, in the end, as a sign of apologized for the troubled regarding the booking. The room that we stayed was the family room, two queen beds. Large and clean room. Good hotel to stay for business, family, or if you go in group of four. They provide free coffee and tea at their lounge of their guest, and also in their library area. All and all, I will return to this hotel if I ever be in Taipei city. ",
