    "detail": "Hotel was located in district 1 and was in walking distance to all main attractions. Despite the hotel being very central me and my husband both said how quiet it was at night which made for a good night's sleep. The rooftop pool and bar is very lovely and calm and nice to view Ho Chi Minh City from, especially at sunset. The staff were lovely and so accomadating. They even let us check in early after a 20 hour flight. Nothing was to much for them. Amazing omelette station as well at breakfast! ",

    "detail": "First, the disadvantage of this hotel's biggest one is the 'location'. It is a very good location based on the accessibility with the Ho Chi Minh attractions, but it is noisy at night because it is located on De Tham street, which is crowded with clubs and nightlife. They may be sensitive to noise, older, or may not fit well with family units. It is a good hotel to choose for young people who like to play with fun. I think it is a 5 star hotel that can be met at a price of $ 40-50. The kindness of all the staff was close to perfection, so that we could forget some of the disadvantages. The room was small, but the structure was made efficient, and I was able to feel the consideration and effort using good furniture and facilities. Especially breakfast was much better than other hotel's buffet, a la carte and basic dishes, all the ingredients and juice were always fresh. I have written a review based on experience using dozens of hotels across Vietnam for business trips.",

    "detail": "This is the third time I have stayed in the Rex Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Each time I have enjoyed the suites which are luxurious and reasonably priced. The tours are very organized and punctual. This time on one of the tours we had to return early as a relative was not well and this was handled considerately and very professionally. This hotel has a grand white marbled floor and red carpet entrance and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are 2 well maintained rooftop swimming pools plus a rooftop bar that has appeared in numerous travel magazines. At the moment they are renovating some of the older room so there is some slight noise in the daytime but otherwise it was not too intrusive. The suites are lovely with large beds, clean linen and good facilities. When next I go back to Ho Chi Minh I hope to return here. ",
