It has al the mod-cons in the room including a massive LED TV with a welcoming message for you and even speakers in the bathroom. Going to this hotel also really helped as I arrived at about 1am in Hong Kong and so didn't need to look for taxis or late-night transport and then hassle with check-ins in Hong Kong City. Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America.

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

    "detail": "we went to hong kong with two elders, 2 teens, 2 child and 4 adults. we booked 2 family quad room with cosmopolitan hotel. shuttle bus airport transfer cost 150hkg per pax is expensive. we choose to take a taxi from airport to the hotel. travel duration is around 30-40mins(depend on traffic). taxi fare range from $290-$350(depend on which toll your taxi driver took). the room is much bigger than normal hotel room among hong kong(usually hong kong hotel room are small). it have 2 queen size beds with other basic facilities. booking with agoda will received free wifi service in the room. other free area are the lobby and restaurant. we have free breakfast vouchers in our package. breakfast are good and suitable for child. the counter staff and concerige staff are very friendly and helpful. they good give valuable and accurate advise to us. cosmopolitan hotel provide many free shuttle bus services to important venue, like central and admiralty. walking to subway is possible, but with elders and young children is a bit challenging as there are a lot stairs and slope to climb. nearest cafe is about 5-10mins walk going through stairs. environment is quiet but if you want to enjoy the bustling of hkg this is not a hotel to stay as most shop closed quite early. overall we love the hotel.",

    "detail": "My wife and I lived in Hong Kong twice, for a total of four years. For most of that time we lived at mid-level on the Victoria side, and we loved the view we had, day and night. There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

    "detail": "We came through Hong Kong for business. Two families, each with an infant. What we wanted was a hotel in Hong Kong that was decently priced and had a swimming pool for the children. This hotel is well-designed and well-maintained. Front desk staff are very professional. There is an hourly shuttle which takes you to/from Tsim Sha Tsui (Peninsula Hotel). In our opinion, the best part about the hotel was the large and beautiful swimming pool. There is a shallow kid's pool which was excellent for the children to play in.",
