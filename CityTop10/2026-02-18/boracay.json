    "detail": "Boracay is definitely a great place for a short honeymoon, or a beach holiday. The people are all super friendly and both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

It has efficient and prompt shuttle services. We did not have to wait for a long time for the shuttles to arrive. Fairways has many of shuttles that are one call away. The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",

    "detail": "We split our stay on Boracay between another establishment on station 2 and this one in order to experience both sides of the island. Station zero, as they have coined it, is a great place to stay unwind and relax after the hustle and bustle of station 2. They do have shuttles back and forth every hour and a half but we didn’t move from the hotel’s private beach for three days! It’s a very nice establishment with a variety of choices for meals. Better than most other places in the Philippines with regards to vegan/vegetarian options. Located in a very quiet area on the north end of the island next to two other fancy hotels, this allowed us have an even larger choice of restaurants once we had tried all of the items on their menu. They also have the best drinks we had in the Philippines and an all day happy hour! The staff were very professional helpful and sweet. Pickup and check in went really smoothly and They went above and beyond when we informed them it was as our honeymoon: they really made it extra special for us. Perhaps the only thing that was less than perfect there was the spa. My wife was really looking forward to it but it didn’t really inspire us.",

    "detail": "It is perfectly located in the heart of D'Mall at Station 2. We arrived earlier than the usual check in time. They allowed us to wait at the poolside on their roofdeck . We got the pool all to ourselves, I guess because the usual tourists would normally like to go to the beach . The staff were all gracious and polite and helpful . I left some stuff at the poolside in our last day, and they were kind enough to deliver it back to our room. the price was reasonable, considering its prime location, and it was still 4 months old when we visited the place i love the Spanish/Filipino/Mediterranean interior decoration and ambience of Feliz . It was a truly HAPPY Boracay stay for us!",

    "detail": "After we landed, things started off bad but once I was able to speak with the manager and staff, the rest of our time went great. The staff and management were wonderful. They should be commended! The hotel is in the perfect location and right on the beach. It is directly beside D-mall. The suite has great views, we highly recommend spending the extra money to enjoy amazing views with excellent privacy. We also highly recommend to utilize their transportation. When you fly to Boracay, you do not land on the island of Boracay. You have to find transportation to the boat dock, pay for boat transportation to Boracay and then find transportation to the hotel. OR If you book with the hotel, they charge you and extra $5 over the price you would pay on your own BUT you have private transportation from the airport to a private boat and the private transportation to the hotel. For $5 it is more than worth it, no hassle, no cramped and crowded public transportation. ",
