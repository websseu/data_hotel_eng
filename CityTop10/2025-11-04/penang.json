Got an early check in at 10.30am (i req for it earlier through Agoda) and the room was really clean. Got a room facing the street but the street is very quiet, not many cars passed through the road so the hotel is suitable for a light sleeper because it is located in a rather quite part of Georgetown. Attractions are located nearby (within walking distance) around 10-15 minutes to most restaurants and museums or you can just Grab at around RM5. The breakfast was fine, nothing extraordinary but you can make your own waffle during the breakfast. Had lunch at the restaurant and the Thai food there is soooooo good that you will sure be back for more! Overall, kudos to the hotel and the management! If i ever come back to Penang, i will surely be staying here again!",

    "name": "Bayview Hotel Georgetown",
    "detail": "1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk, street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road! Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang. The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!). We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning. And were we glad we did. We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you! Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up",

    "detail": "Our stay at The Royale Bintang Penang Hotel was a really enjoyable stay. The hotel is very conveniently located to anything and everything you would want to see. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant also provides a very comprehensive and well rounded morning buffet. The manager who greeted and seated us was especially pleasant and it was a nice welcome. I would also like to say that management is also very pleasant. I wanted to mention this because we ran into a nicely dressed gentlemen who must have been the general manager in the elevator and then outside the restaurant. I am sorry I didn't get his name, but he took time to explain some of the history of his hotel. His warm and friendly manner was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have a memorable stay in Penang.",

    "name": "Grand Swiss Hotel",
    "detail": "Very clean, friendly staff, and strategic place where easy to find restaurants, cafe, and street foods. (Penang is foods heaven) Can walk within a few minutes to the street art and museum. Also can take bus in Jalan Penang (rapid & hop on hop off bus) which is 5 mins from hotel. Oh.. You also can buy ticket for hop on hop off bus in the hotel's counter. MYR 19 for Malaysian adults. (but i prefer uber haha). This hotel is also safe and not really near the traffic. Could not hear any noise from the room though. They also provide tea and coffee at 1.00 - 6.00 pm free for customers even if you book a room that is not include the breakfast. But, they only provide one socket and not enough to charge phones, laptop, etc. The room also quite small but it is just okay if you're just find a room to sleep at night. In conclusion, this hotel is worth what i paid. I will definitely recommend this hotel for my family & friends. Thank you. ",
