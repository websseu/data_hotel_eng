    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",

    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",
