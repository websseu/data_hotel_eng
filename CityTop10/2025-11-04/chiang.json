This is the best hotel in the location if you want luxury at a good value. The food here was very good also. This was our first time taking young children with us to Chiang Mai. The staff were very friendly and helpful with the children who were ages 1 and 3. We will definitely come back to the Centara. We love Chiang Mai.",

The Maya Shopping Center is a short walk away. Our room at the third floor, which featured Pop Art, was compact but adequately sized and very comfortable. The bathroom was well designed and relatively large. The room was excellently soundproofed. Despite looking out at the road, we heard almost no street noise. The staff was warm and welcoming. The front desk was well organized and easily able to answer our questions. The restaurant staff did an excellent job handling the busy morning buffet breakfast. Rather than have egg dishes on the buffet, servers take orders and have them individually prepared. We enjoyed viewing the paintings in the art gallery. Our friends in Chiang Mai had no problem finding the hotel. However, it is a 15 to 20 minute ride by tuk-tuk into the center of the old town where many of the temples and museums are located. Nonetheless, we would recommend this well-run hotel to friends, especially if they wish to stay near Nimmanhaemin Road or Chiang Mai University. ",

The breakfast buffet has much variety, catering for all tastes and there are many staff on watch to top up your coffee. The Lobby tourist information desk is helpful. It is 10 minutes’ walk to the Night Markets however, they have become overpriced with limited variety of goods. However, this is the best location nearby for a wide range of mid to higher priced cafes, restaurants and bars. Without these markets (starting at 6 pm) the nearby eating, drinking and shopping options are limited. Chiang Mai is a large city where tourist attractions are spaced a long way apart. There is not really a central Chiang Mai location for a hotel. There are plenty of transport options from the Empress. The airport is some 20 minutes’ drive away, costing around 160 THB by taxi. Chiang Mai has a very broad variety of attractions and a range of organised tours are available. Such tours usually include visits to wildlife and adventure activities plus jewellery and craft stores. The craft and artistry in Chiang Mai are amazing and worth seeing but can be expensive to buy. The taxi driver from the airport gave his business card, offering pre-arranged tours or a full daytime charter costing 2000 THB where you chose where you go or not go. I chose to focus on the religious, cultural and historical attractions. Visiting only these attractions took 2 full days and the driver visited many wonderful modern and ancient places. Before, I did not know that Chiang Mai had such a rich ancient history, ruins and similar attractions. These are not that well promoted as wildlife, adventure and crafts seem to have the best publicity. Sadly the Chiang Mai Zoo, which was amazing before, has gone down badly and is obviously struggling. The big drought in Thailand is not helping matters. After the disappointment of the Chiang Mai",
