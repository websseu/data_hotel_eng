    "detail": "It took us a while to check in as it has a very small reception, probably as it did not have as many rooms. The guests before us had some deposit issues and the staff (trainee) was unable to handle very well. Although they had up to 2 other staff arrived to handle that issue, they completely ignored us until I insisted to be served and checked in. Rooms are truly spacious and luxuriously decorated but one of the rooms had bad smell emanating from the toilet. I wonder if it is becos hotel was converted from old shophouses. Anyhow, we are quite happy with the rooms so we didn't make an issue out of it. One of the rooms had a huge bed, bigger than a king-sized bed, comfortably sleeping 3-4 persons. Hotel was well located, most places was walking distances away n not too near crowded or noisy places. We walked everywhere to explore the heritage and historical sites. They served set breakfast and their restaurant faces the river, which was lovely to have a meal in the morning as it was very nice, charming and breezy and during the night for beer or wine. Staff are warm and friendly, just maybe not as well trained. Perhaps a professional Manager doing his rounds will help improve matters n straighten out their priorities. We love this hotel and if we ever return to Malacca, this with definitely be our choice stay. ",

    "detail": "My stay in this hotel was awesome. We found out the name of this Hotel : 1825 is the year of the building is built. Which mean this building is 190 years old. I came all the way down to Malacca from Singapore and i'm glad i made the right choice. First, this hotel is newly opened not more than 1 month so there is some sort of smell like the smell of the wood. It wasn't really a big deal. I also like the service they provided. Their receptionist is very friendly and helpful. Most importantly, the location there is very convenience. The famous stall that selling fried oyster omelet is just opposite the road site. The famous longkang lala&siham also nearby. Just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Of course the christ church is 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. The famous Jonker street The most famous night market in Malacca)is just 10 minutes walk away from the hotel there. We also went to the Dataran Pahlawan which nearby you can try taking the tricycle around there. I would highly recommend this hotel. Location, services, designs and the comfort. Everything just nice. Just the weather in Malacca very hot no doubt. i had been attracted by the : Lava Stones which decorated on the back wall of the building and internal wall.",
