    "detail": "We decided to spend songkran down at a beach location, and I had never been to Krabi before. When deciding on a Krabi hotel, I wanted a decent sized resort in a central location, that was right on the beach. Krabi Resort ticked all those boxes. When I arrived, I quickly determined that I had picked the optimal resort for the area as Krabi resort was the most centrally located, and one of only a very few that had direct access to the beach. The reason is the resort is one of the originals for the area, but the over the years it has expanded a lot, meaning you can choose between a lot of accommodation options, eg hotel style rooms, or semi detached rooms, to fully detached villas with their own private pool. The resort itself is large and they drive you to your room after you check in. Facilities include two pool areas (one done like a pirate ship), a fantastic gym, large scale chess board with pieces set up, multiple restaurants, mini golf, bicycles for rent, beach, massage etc.",

    "detail": "Our stay was awesome! So much so that we went to Phi Phi for a few nights, then skipped Krabi town and came back here! The pool is a little small and crowded, the check in staff can be a little slow and the eggs lady at breakfast was pretty clueless but apart from that I totally loved it here. One thing their website doesn't say is that while it's in Krabi it's only accessible by boat. We drove, and had a hard time finding the office to park our car at but we found it in the end near the jetty. Our car was safe for a period of 5 nights and parking was free. The boat ride over was cheap, but pack light because lugging a suitcase from boat to boat wears thin! When you're at Realeigh Beach Krabi (the beach this hotel is on) make sure you walk around and check out the whole area - east and west side. Tip: get up early, the beach was deserted until about 8am (so too was the breakfast buffet). Meals in the restaurant were super tasty, much more expensive than other areas but generous serves and really tasty. The hotel has an activities centre that organises great day trips - make sure you pop in there to do a day trip. A day trip to all the islands was great fun - Chicken Island etc. The boat that the hotel organised was by far the best boat out on the water that day, so while it might be a tad more expensive it was worth it. We left our wallets, keys etc on the boat and they were well looked after by the staff. They also did a head count each time we got out to swim so safety was important to them - definitely recommend doing this through the hotel. Walking Street is right next door, although pretty small so don't expect much. I'll be skipping Krabi town next time I'm in the area and heading straight here. Best hotel in Krabi I think! ",

    "detail": "Writing this my the roof top pool, looking out at the sea. Don't really write reviews but after a bad start in thailand and this place been a slice of luxury, I felt I owe it to others to write a review. I had a bad start in a hotel a few hotels down, which was not clean and small pool, I then moved to the princeas for only £6 more and it is like a different world. Cold towel and juice on arrival, friendly staff and a bell not to carry your bags. Big room, lovely clean modern bathroom, balcony and free water tea and coffee. 2 swimming pools, one on the roof, free towels, pool side service,mini mart and beautiful restaurant, massive buffet breakfast and free wifi in all areas of the hotel. The staff are really friendly and helpful. On the east side so a short safe walk to the more busy bars and then 10 min walk to the west and sunset beach. Lots of places to eat cheaply and well near buy and lots of places to book tours, found last bar the best and cheapest prices for this. Love this hotel and can't recommend enough !! ",

    "detail": "I stayed in three hotels in Krabi over the course of a week to try out different areas. This was definitely the best. The location is superb. It's 5 minutes' walk to the beach and the main strip of shops and restaurants is only about 50 meters away. The room was bright and spacious and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. The deluxe rooms face the ocean and I think it's well worth paying a bit extra. The buffet breakfast wasn't that great, but with literally dozens of cheap alternatives nearby, it's hardly important. There is a fantastic seafood restaurant called Bamboo located not far from Krabi Heritage. To get there, turn right on the main street when you exit reception. My wife and I tried loads of restaurants in the week we were in Krabi; this was the only one we went back to. Also, there is a really good bar nearby with nightly live music called The Irish Rover. Even though there is a lot of nightlife nearby, the hotel itself is quiet and peaceful once you're inside. Would definitely stay at the Krabi Heritage again. Nice enough hotel and it was great being in the middle of everything and not needing transport. Recommended.",
