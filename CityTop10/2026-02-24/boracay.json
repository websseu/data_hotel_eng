    "detail": "We rented a kayak suggested by the staff at the savoy hotel side of the beach the sister company of fairways. The paddle broke midway without hitting any rocks. We were at the deep part of the water. Our safety had been compromised and the manager made us pay 5000 pesos for the paddle even though it wasn't our fault. The manager robbie and his people were very rude talking to us as if we were criminals. Never in my life have I been treated like this in any of the hotels I have stayed. The manager also insisted that he wanted cash and credit card was not allowed . We were suspicious so we only told him we will pay in card only and he got angry. In the end it was resolved by another manager which allowed us to pay in credit card and lower the amount to 5000 which is still very high(original amount asking is 6000). Very scam worthy. Would not recommend to anyone ever ",

    "detail": "Boracay is definitely a great place for a short honeymoon, or a beach holiday. The people are all super friendly and both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

    "detail": "My husband and I went to Boracay for my birthday celebration and we both enjoyed our stay in Ferra. It’s just about 7mins walk going to the beach and alot of establishments are just within the vicinity of the hotel which is very convenient. Dmall is just about 5 mins walk and there are banks/ATM and fastfoods and other restaurants. All their staff are polite, very accomodating and responds to our queries right away. We arrived in the hotel around 12:30pm and they offered us a refreshing complementary drinks. But, we had to wait until 2pm for check in time since our room is not yet ready. All of them greets their guests with a big smile even their guard. Upon checking in I was suprised that the room they provided us with bigger one, cause I booked for deluxe queen and fortunately we have the king size room equipped with bathtub. In terms of cleanliness, everything is clean and they change the linens when we requested for it. Clean towels are provided everyday as well. One problem we encountered is the wifi connection. We had to call the reception just so we can connect everytime, I dunno what’s wrong, but ones we’re connected the internet speed is okay. The breakfast buffet is also great, i loved their beef tapas. 😊 Our flight going back is 8:20am so we had to leave early and they provided us with packed sandwich and a bottle of water. Thank you ferra! We will be back definitely! ",

    "detail": "The Paradise Garden Resort Hotel is perfectly positioned between Station 2 and Station 3 on Boracay Island. The resort is quite big and runs from the street front to the Beach making it only 30-40meters from the water. Most of the hotels have a beach frontage which is a must when selecting a property in Boracay. The hotel has a wonderful restaurant on the beach front which is were you have your breakfast. Breakfasts cater more for the Chinese and Korean palate rather than westerners but lunch and dinners are great, especially the lunch buffet ($US12-13) which includes unlimited beers at that price. It has two pool areas and you can always find a banana chair most times of the day. From the hotel you come out on the beach side and walk along the sand to a really good selection of bars and restaurants where you can find dining options ranging from $10/person to as expensive as $50/person. You can get even cheaper in the traditional Philippino restaurants if your game LOL. ",
