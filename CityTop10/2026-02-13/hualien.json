    "name": "Hualien Wow Hostel",
    "detail": "Location is very strategic and convenient because it’s very near Hualien station. Wherever u wanna go in Hualien, it has the best location to go from because most public buses and trains are all accessible here at Hualien station. It’s a green building hostel and easily spotted across from the station. There’s a cafe at the entrance of the building, or other alternatives like 7-11 is just a stone throw away. Beside the building is Hualien’s very famous Mochi Store which tasted superbly good. Hostel service was really beyond expected. Months before check-in date I was already contacted by their staff members via WhatsApp regarding on our itinerary and booking assistance whichever that we required. Or even just a simple enquiry that u may have about Hualien, they would be glad to answer or assist with. We managed to reserve 2 outdoor activities that we wanna participate in Hualien through their assistance in the bookings and the best part is we could make payment on our check-in date itself, without going through complicated bank transfers or emailing of personal documents. Through WoW Hostel helps to save up all the hassle and complicated procedures. Hygiene for the hostel is really, really clean. I have never seen such a clean hostel and their hygiene really impressed me. Facilities of the hostel is very pleasant and cosy. Very old school/retro vibe environment and simple toast and coffee provided for Breakfast every morning. Beds are quite comfy and sufficient space provided for luggages, adequate privacy and space if you’re staying in dormitory style rooms. Language communication maybe a bit difficult if you can’t communicate in Chinese, but some of the staff there knows little English so they will try their best to help u. Overall it’s super value for money, I will always come back here if I ever get the chance to travel around Hualien the next time.",

    "detail": "Walking distance to and from Hualien Station. Just look out for a bright yellow building which is very visible from the station. Staff service is impeccable and exemplary. They would drop whatever they are going just to greet you aloud, like Japanese style. Close to dining options too though bit far to night market. But no fault of theirs. 1st hotel we come across that serves supper and its so sumptious with noodles, porridge etc which can be considered as late dinner. Lots of variety for buffet breakfast too. You will be spoilt for choice. They tried to arrange a Taroka Gorge day trip for us. But travel agency advised not to go there as they are falling rocks and stones. Instead we spend time in Hualien city instead. We book a business double but they upgraded us free to a quad room with 2 queen beds equipped with a bath tub. 2 thumbs up to them. Only issue is sound proofing can be better. You can literally hear conversations when people talk and pass by the corridor outside. ",

They will try to answer any questions your may have regarding Hualien/Taiwan. Simple clean and comfy room. I like the sitting area where you can chill after a tiring day out. However, please take note the check in time is 3pm. I was there at 2:30pm and there were no person to attend to me. I could not even enter the premise. Perhaps that is something the management can look into. Even we cannot go into the room, at least there is a reception to allow us to leave our luggages etc.",

Very helpful pick up shuttle service which makes things much easier. Really thankful for one of the staff (didn't get his name) because he patiently waited for us to reach the train station (twice) cos of miscommunication about my arrival time at the Hualien train station. There is almost no space for opening the luggage on the floor. And shower is directly in front of the main toilet door, so have to be aware when bathing or the water will flow out onto the bedroom floor. Only four hooks or so for hanging. Breakfast wasn't too bad.",

Hualien's attractions are sporadic - so it is a lot more efficient to stay nearby the inter-state station than trying to find a place nearby some of the attractions. Plus, most of the main attractions are outside Hualien and you will need to take the bus to get around. 3) Very clean 4) The staffs were very hospitable, excited and cheerful. I was very impressed with their customer service. I left a metal ear pick in my hotel room after I left which I could not care less, and the staffs called and even sent me an e-mail stating that they were more than happy to post it! A bit extra but hey, for a small hotel in a small town, this hotel has better customer service than some of the 4-5 star hotel I had been to. 5) You can hire bicycles for free! As mentioned earlier, Hualien 's attractions are sporadic - riding a bicycles would make your trip a lot more fun! I personally feel like a stay in Hualien is incomplete without riding a bicycle around the town - plus it is free!",

He will be able to assist you with tour bookings & arrangements. :) Place is clean and cozy, equipped pretty much all the basic needs for travellers.

    "detail": "Our stay at Fullon Hotel Hualien was during the time the 6.4-scale earth quake landed in Hualien City. If we had the foresight, we probably wouldn't be in Hualien at that time, but we were there, and were so glad that we stayed at Fullon Hotel! During our last night of planned stay there, we were jolted awake by the quake around midnight in our 10th floor room. The first strong quake was followed by significant after shocks. The hotel staff soon started knocking on the door to help us evacuate to the 1st floor lobby. There, we found bundles of towels/blankets and cases of bottled water to help settling the guests. The staff even prepared a van to drive guests who felt the need to be on an open space to the adjacent open lot. At 6:30 am, the buffet breakfast was ready, and was as sumptuous as the day before, prepared by workers who came to work on time regardless their own need at home! Such a well-built hotel, with dedicated and attentive staff! Where else would we have rather be!! ",

The environment was cordial and the hotel staff members were friendly, helpful and took initiative to collect train tickets for us when we requested them to book the tickets. Even though the hotel was just 15 minutes drive from the train station,it is not very accessible. However, this was compensated by the free shuttle service provided by the staff. The manager fetch us from the train station when we arrived to Hualien and the assistant manager sent us to the train station when we check out. This was definitely one of the best experience we had in Taiwan so far.",
