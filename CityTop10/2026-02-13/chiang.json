    "detail": "I stayed at De Chai the deco for 3 nights. I have to say that this is the best De Chai compared to the other De Chai hotels in Chiang Mai that I have stayed in. The staff speaks very good english and are always providing advice on where to go, and how much the fares should be. When we bought some apples from the open air market and tried to borrow a bread knife from the kitchen at De Chai, the staff offered to slice them up for us. 15 minutes later, the staff came to our room with a beautiful place of nicely sliced apples. This is what differentiate De Chai the Deco hotel from all the other Chiang Mai hotels we have previously stayed in. The attention to the little details. ",

    "detail": "1. Comparing with the other hotels in Chiang Mai, Kokotel's price is very cheap. 2. The location is far away from the Old Town (4km which is not able to walk under the hot weather). You always need to take the tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Old Town. The hotel is near the Nimman District and you are able to take a walk about 10 minutes to the Nimman District. The location of the hotel is difficult to describe, most of the drivers did not realize the exact location. It would be better to ask the Road Number in Thailand Language in order to tell the tuk-tuk / songthaew drivers. 3. Room is clean and the toilet is also clean. 4. Staff is nice and helpful. They will provide the tourist information for you such as the Saturday/ Sunday night market. 5. Providing a breadfast starting from 07:00AM to 10:00AM. Helping us to call the airport taxi service at mid-night. Although the taxi service is not provided by the hotel, the taxi driver is also polite and helping us to take the luggage.",

Located a bit outside the city center, you can definitely find all you need for a good night sleep. The staffs are super friendly, rooms are clean, and the location is peaceful and quiet. There were a few flaws to my stay: the room phone we're wired when we arrived, the bathroom smelled a bit funky, the door lock wasn't working, and the shower was a bit broken, but the staffs handled them very swift and professionally and we were all good by the second day of the stay. It might not be as convenient to get here if you don't have a mode of personal transportation (rented car or bike), but if you do, there's plenty of roofed parking available with 24 hours security. Overall it was a pleasant experience, would come by again if I ever need another budget stay in Chiang Mai. ",

The Wi-Fi worked excellent in our room and everywhere in hotel. And did I mention they have a great little pool for cooling off after a hot day hiking around town? The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The front desk helped us book a trip to Chiang Rai and everything worked out great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for the money. I'd also recommend booking your hotel with the included breakfast. The breakfast has a good selection of both western and Asian items and you could even get omelets or eggs cooked to order. Coffee, tea, juice, toast and a good selection of fresh fruits were also available. Next trip to Chiang Mai I won't need to research a place to stay, I'll be staying here.",

    "detail": "This was our best stay of all 4 Chiang Mai hotels we stayed at. I loved the family room we booked, very spacious, new and fresh decor. The most comfortable beds I've had in Thailand yet. And two bathrooms! More than worth the 1000 baht we paid. The front desk staff were wonderful and helpful. The pool was great although could be cleaner. A short walk to Wat Phra Singh, and the popular walking street, Ratchamandoen. Rent bicycles and ride all over town!",

    "detail": "simply the right choice to be based and explore chiang mai, or to relax at the gym and swimming pool / sun roof. wonderfully attentive staff. the concierge was so friendly and caring. he suggested what activities we could do and asked us what we preferred. when i told him that hiring a scooter would be our first choice he called the motor rent. within 15 minutes 3 scooters were delivered at the hotel for baht a day. far lower rates than elsewhere. yes, the hotel shows it age. during my first stay it was a westin, than sheraton and now holliday inn. i still remember when it was grand and one of the top places on the river bank on the out skirts of chiang mai. now it is a efficient place, great service and good vale for money. for 6 days we had 2 executive river view including a very good breakfast buffet, free wifi internet and 2 free laundry items a day. executive river view means spacious rooms with breathtaking views from the top floors. the best to explore and understand the lay out of the city and its surroundings. there is no best location in chiang mai. if located in the old city it is as for to the night market as from the holliday inn. staying in the night market area it is not so close to china town and its markets. doi suthep, ban tawai or sankamphaeng is out of the city any way and hiring scooters solves the hassle of finding tuk-tuks or taxis. despite of the free hotel shuttle to the night market. i will remember the holliday inn chiang mai as the right choice that contributed to a great stay in the north of thailand.
