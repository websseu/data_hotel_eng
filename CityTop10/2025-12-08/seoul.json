Also, we went to emart via exit no. 4 for shopping before we left for airport. You can also get tax refunds on non-perishable items at emart. Coffee shops, fried chicken stalls and eating places (even Korean beef) are just opposite the road. The interior design of the room is modern with shelves, storage, hangers and beds are all very handy with a feeling of your own house. This is the best hotel I have stayed after years of travel in Korea. ",

Staff changed my room for me very efficiently and graciously on Day 2 after complaining of road noise on Day 1. Neutral - elevators are reasonably fast and only require long wait at peak time, there are only 2 coin washers so I had to walk to a nearby private coin laundry center. Cons - Wifi doesn't work well (bad range and also very unstable connection), gym is small/not that good (but there are several gyms in the immediate vicinity), some rooms have road noise, the rooms are a bit small, TV channel selection is bad (e.g. no NBA basketball on SpoTV 1/2).",

    "detail": "Stayed in a group of 3. Airport bus drop off is opposite. Have to drag luggages down and up a long flight of stairs to cross over the road as there’s no available crossings nearby. Short slope walk upwards to hotel. However airport bus pick up towards airport is very convenient right outside the hotel. Convenience store beside hotel with a cafe. Easy to buy snacks and drinks for breakfast. Great bbq store across the road outside the underpass exit!! Highly recommended. Room was clean and comfortable. 6 nights $600 for 3 pax was a very good deal. Sound proofing is soso. Depends on your luck on how considerate your neighbour is gonna be. Reception staff some were friendly and helpful, one we encountered was quite hostile. But generally, able to converse in English and provide clear instructions. Recommend to cab around instead. From hotel to ewha was around 8k won. Hotel to Seoul station 5k won. Very cheap to cab. Myeongdong is just less than 5 mins away too. ",
