    "detail": "I am going to book Dream hotel for the 4th time know!!!! This is the best affordable hotel in Bangkok to my opinion. The hotel is separated in 2 buildings. One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

Even though there are Bangkok hotels which looked more impressive through my research, thought I'd just trust the first hand experience for myself and book Asia Hotel. I would say Asia Hotel is the finest hotel and value for money I have ever stayed. 5 star service. Staff are patient and willing to go the extra mile. They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

    "detail": "A regular visitor to Thailand I stayed in the excellent Ambassador Hotel on Soi 11off Sukhumvit this time. I say excellent because the standard is exactly how a €40+ per night 4 star in Bangkok should be.The Ambassador is a big property with many amenities. The reception area is huge and the staff are friendly and efficient. My luggage was taken from the Taxi and appeared in my room within minutes of me entering my room.The initial impression you get when you walk in to the reception area is 5 star but the rooms put it firmly back in the second division.They are not bad but quite basic. Everything works and at this price you can't ask for more. The WiFi is free and strong but does require constant re-entering of passwords which is annoying at first but you get used to it. Room cleaning is efficient and flexible. Long low timber ceiling corridors give it a kind of old cruise liner feel. Restaurants, Bars, Massage studio, Gym, Tailoring shops, health spa and several coffee shops are among it's many features. And of course that great location close to everything. Some of the best restaurants in Bangkok are here.The very expensive but superb El Gaucho Steakhouse,one of 2 in the area, is right next door. For Mexican try the Coyote across the road. And round the corner the Firehouse serves the best burgers in Bangkok. An Aussie Bar also across the road serves up the traditional full breakfast. I would recommend the Ambassador as a budget hotel without hesitation. ",
