    "detail": "This is a set of dorm flats for the London School of Economics that they rent out during school holidays for extra income to help lower the costs of student rents. My flat had 4-5 private bedrooms, a kitchen (that I didn't use), one shared toilet, and one shared shower (both in separate small rooms). They provide towels, shampoo/soap/body gel, and a bath mat. The room included a nice single bed, great view of London, a sink/mirror, and plenty of cabinet/desk space. Wifi was excellent, and registering also gave you access to Sky hotspots around London. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast buffet served on the ground floor was quite good, with many continental options and all you can eat/drink. Even though I don't particularly like the shared bathroom concept (not 15 years after uni), I would definitely stay here again; for the price and location 5 min walk from Covent Garden, the value absolutely can not be beaten.",

The common areas are light, fresh and guest friendly. The rooms vary: some are VERY small, but still adequate, while others are quite roomy. All have modern bathrooms, which is a real relief, although I would say that a bit of attention to cleaning detail now will save a lot of unnecessary maintenance later. The staff are reserved but always helpful. The location is perfect being just around the corner from Earls Court Station and busy, bustling Earls Court Road. I would definitely recommend this hotel in the three-star category; however, sometimes the price is on the high side. Book early to get value for money. ",

I have no idea what the other guest were doing but at 3am, 4am, 5am, 6am on various nights etc... people were walking around, moving furniture? dropping things! doors closing multiple times (i'm assuming the people above were checking out and catching an early flight) but seriously I had ear plugs on and i could still head all the floor boards creaking. I thought someone was doing renovations in the middle of the night. So after 7 nights of this...i'm seriously sleep deprived and I would recommend this place only to a VERY HEAVY SLEEPER. someone who can sleep though all the sounds. ",

The room was clean during the stay (hotel will NOT change your bed sheets but Will make the bed for you). Shampoo, bodywash, and soaps were refilled. The room had a good air conditioner, unlimited hot water from the shower, and a small TV which had a minor issue(maybe resolution problem). Wifi was working fine and okay speed. I was also satisfied with the breakfast buffet. It had various menus and decent taste. I liked how they took care of little details such as preparing small plastic spoons for their yogurts. Although the price wasn't cheap for me as a traveling student, but it is probably because I booked the room a day before my stay. In general, I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.",

It’s busy and open until late (around 2-3 am). 3-4 minutes to Bayswater station and 6 minutes to Queensway station. Breakfast is suppppperb!!! Room - I stayed in a single room but I had done my research about the size of the rooms in the hotel in London, so wasn’t disappointed. The room is definitely small. Only negative that I can say are the pillows. Not the best as I got neck pain after my first place (thankfully there is a massage parlour 2 minutes from the hotel). Definitely worth the money.

    "detail": "I stayed here for one night in late October. I got a bed in a shared room for very cheap, obviously this is ideal if you're a young traveler on a budget wanting to stay in central London! But saving money can come at the expense of your well being...I have a motto of 'you get what you pay for', and I think next time I'll have to spend a little more for the sake of a good nights sleep. In my opinion its false economy if you get a cheap room but the worst night sleep of your life, and thus the next day of your life is spent feeling like sh**. So yeah you saved money, but spent a lot more in terms of stress. The room I stayed in was just awful - a small, long room with very high ceilings, which meant that three triple-story bunk beds were crammed into it. The beds rocked and wobbled like crazy each time I climbed mine, and whenever the sleeper above me moved or climbed up/down, the disturbance was hideous. Someone might as well have been shaking me with their bare hands. The beds were also very small, smaller than a single bed, and cramped. No where to put luggage either. There was no ventilation except for a small fan. It was VERY hot and VERY uncomfortable. Last but not least, the noise from the neighboring room was super loud and intrusive. I know its a cheap hostel in central London, but not everyone chooses to stay in one of these because they're interested in bar crawls! All I could hear almost all night was a hoard of yelling, drunken yobs. After a night of tossing, turning, noise and a quaking bed I spent most of my morning feeling crap, and it showed. Who wants to feel like that when they're having a weekend in the city?? I don't understand why some of these cheap hostels can't have half of the hostel a more peaceful zone, and the other half a party-goers/pub-crawl zone. I don't think it would cost much to do that! The staff at reception were nice. The bathrooms were alright. Just basic, like college toilets. At least they weren't too grubby. Although I will",
