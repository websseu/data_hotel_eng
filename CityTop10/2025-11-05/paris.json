    "detail": "Came across the hotel on Agoda with a very reasonable price of 69 euros per night. Photos looked good and the location was great in the trendy 9th with hip restaurants in the neighborhood, good access to 2 metro stations and easy walking distance to central Paris landmarks and shops. Loved the theatrical theme to the hotel decoration. Breakfast was good at a reasonable price. Very easy to relax in the lounge area over lots of croissants, french bread et al. Evening free champagne time is a great touch, too! Will definitely stay there again when I visit Paris. Overall, staff were super, duper friendly.",

    "detail": "Well i booked this hotel because of its cheap price hotel. But then after i booked it, then i read the reviews. Yeah.. i should read em before i book it. Anyway.. From all the reviews, The hotel gets the bad reviews more than good. With all the bad room, dirty bed & all dirty bathroom & rude staff. I was kinda afraid that I'll be having the same bad experience. But Alhamdulillah, when we reached the hotel yes, from the outside the looks of the hotel was terrifying tho. But when we reach the reception desk, surprisingly the staff was very friendly. The check in was fast & we can immediately go to our room. Bad news, there's no lift. So we have to climb the stairs. Another bad news our room is at 5th floor. Well, its o then because i read all the reviews most of the guest complaining about the stairs. Well I don't really mind actually. Another way for me to workout while travelling. But bad news for old people with large baggage tho. Anyway, when we reach our room, from all the bad reviews stated that the room was dirty & bad, surprisingly ours & other rooms were clean. This includes the bed, floor, & bathroom. The tv working fine too. So.. to me the hotel is value for money. But seriously it was not as bad as the previous guest stated how bad the hotel was. Maybe the hotel has a new owner & do some changes? IDK but Alhamdulillah we got a good room & a good hotel with the best location. So I will recommend this hotel to all especially young people & young lover who love some adventures climbing the stairs. Because using stairs is much more better than using lift. We can burn some calories ya? But I'll not suggest this hotel to old people because the of the stairs. Overall, the hotel is a good hotel. I will come back again & i will stay again in this hotel. :-D",

They had some pretty good toiletries and a really nice showerhead. Bed was the comfiest we've had in our entire Euro trip. Room was complete with a coffee maker, chocolates and biscuits. Location was a little far from the attractions but we didnt mind taking long walks because of the nice weather. There were also a lot of nice bistros and pattisseries around the hotel.",

I flew into Orly from Toulouse. I was able to go directly to the hotel on Orlyval with one transfer in under an hour. My hotel room was ready and perfect; with views of the Arche. If you have an early flight or simply want to make sure you get to CDG with the least amount of issues, ask the hotel to arrange at taxi. It’s on time and comfortable, worth the money. Sit outside in the evenings and watch the Eiffel Tower light up, run along the river. My favorite Paris Hotel.",

    "name": "INNSiDE Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport",
    "detail": "The room is spacious, modern and clean. I stayed one night in this hotel because I had an early flight from CDG airport, and during that period, there was a major strike happening in Paris and all across France, so the transportation system was totally disrupted in Paris, a bit chaotic. I made the best choice staying at this hotel because I didn't want to miss my flight. It was very convenient to reach the airport from this hotel. You could go by foot to reach the airport shuttle train.",
