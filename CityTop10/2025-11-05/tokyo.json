However, it's inside Kabuki-cho, which is one of the best place to have a night drink in Tokyo. But also, the staff is very kind as they kept my 50,000 yens CoD order while other hotels in Tokyo would refuse. For French visitors who are not fluent in English, this is the right place to find French-speaking staff. The room size is correct according to Tokyo standards and it's equipped with Shiseido amenities everywhere. I would also recommend to have a delicious breakfast on the top of the hotel to get a wonderful landscape of Tokyo.",

    "name": "Shinjuku Kuyakusho-mae Capsule Hotel",
    "detail": "Everyone should try the capsule hotel experience at least one night when visiting Japan. So did I and picked this hotel based on the reviews on Agoda and couldn't be happier! The hotel is located in a 8 story building in Kabukicho, Shinjuku and it's very easy to get there. The reception is in floor 3, a common area for men & women with kitchen, restaurants, vending machines and internet café is located in floor 4. Floor 5 is used for day use capsules while the night capsules for men are located in floors 6 & 7. Women can stay in floor 8, separated from men. Staff was super nice and welcoming (contrary to some opinions here), they tried to help me from the very beginning and the people I talked to spoke fairly good English. Although customers are assigned a small locker with enough space to leave the clothes in a changing room, bigger luggage can be stored on some shelves present in both the changing room and in front of the reception. Don't be scared of leaving your items there, this is Japan and everybody respects your belongings. The place is clean and the capsule is much bigger than pictured!! Inside there is a control panel for the light, alarm, air conditioner and television, a power socket and a mirror along with the pillow and a duvet. All capsules have a curtain than can be opened/closed for privacy and but beware that some noises can come inside if other guests speak loudly (usually don't). The hotel also has a traditional Japanese bath (onsen) and sauna. Don't forget to try it before you leave! Checkout time is at 10 am and luggage cannot be stored after checking out. I had a great experience at Shinjuku Kuyakusho-mae Capsule Hotel and will definitely come back in my next trip to Tokyo.",

There's free breakfast in the mornings and free beer hour in the afternoons.

    "detail": "There are bigger, more expensive hotels in Tokyo with better facilities, but if you are looking for a fantastic Boutique Design hotel in Tokyo at a reasonable price then stay here... Great location right by shibuya train station, friendly staff, small but cool rooms, and eclectic mix of hip clients, and most importantly bikes that you can borrow. One point, the slightly larger rooms are a hole lot more comfortable if you value your space, so book at least a modern double if you need to swing a cat. I've been to tokyo dozens of times, and stayed in scores of hotels, and when the client isn't paying for something more top shelf i always stay here. ",
