    "detail": "Apart from the rather sluggish wifi connection, the hotel exceeded all my expectations. The room was great, breakfast spread was filling with great variety, and the staff (especially housekeeping and front desk) were prompt, attentive and quick to serve. I have stayed at several different hotels in Manila and would highly recommend St Giles. It's also a stone's throw away from the night life. But if you have guests who drive, then be prepared for a rather narrow, small and very limited car park.",

The location is good, just across NAIA terminal 3 (they provide a free shuttle bus every hour from the airport to the hotel. You can find the buses at the arrival gate at the ground floor of the airport). There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

Also watertemperture, even when running longer, changed from hot to cold and vice-versa often. In the hallway and the room there was a funny smell. What we really liked about the hotel was the location in the CBD of Makati. Super convenient. We chose this hotel primarily because of its location, but were surprised about the luxury look it had. Room felt like a condo, it had an own kitchen complete with flatware and cutlery. Many thanks to the very accommodating security staff Erwin. When looking for a hotel in Manila again this sure will be it. ",

The beds were great and the pillows too, I had a great sleep. The little things, TV had a huge number of channels to use, tee and coffee facilities, even a wine bottle opener, nick naks in the writing draw to assist you from paper clips to stapler. The bathroom was big and clean. We dinned on the rooftop, the Mongolian BBQ was not the greatest but was good, more spices were needed and more veg's too. The service was great and the ambiance was excellent. Night time above the maddening traffic of Manila was magic. The pool was excellent, while relatively small it was adequate and refreshing. My daughter loved it. Recommend this hotel .. yes definitely. All the staff were great, guys out front, the front desk crew, waiters and waitresses, cleaning staff all were happy, smiling and accommodating. I have finally found a great hotel in Manila, yes I will return.",

My favorite thing about our stay in the hotel was the rooftop view from the top floor of the hotel where the pool was also located. You can lounge there while enjoying the view. They also have a sauna and a gym. The staff was also very helpful. They immediately helped me when I got locked out of my room because the automatic doorknob needed a change in battery. The food at the restaurant was delectable. There's a Starbucks on the same building of the hotel and there are a couple other restaurants around the Resorts World area which are easily accessible from the hotel. This hotel accommodated our last minute booking because our supposed first booking at another hotel also got cancelled last minute. Anyway, this hotel turned out to be better than we've expected and it's a great value for your money.",

I did not ask them to fix it. When we checked in, I explained that I had booked 2 nights, but I would be staying only one night, and the second night my wife would like her friend to stay over for company. Initially, they wanted to charge 1000 Peso, but after a bit of chatting they agreed to waive it. After all, we were not having extra people stay, no additional numbers for breakfast. The one gripe I do have, and hotel please take note: I went to have a drink of water from the supplied water bottles, and it tasted terrible. I looked closer at the bottle and it said Natural Drinking Water. So that means Tap Water, or water from a well or lake. Now I have drunk tap water in Davao, and its clean and tastes ok, but in Manila?? No way. Bottled water is cheap, so why not just have distilled water?? Surely that is better, and safer for your guests. ",

    "detail": "Literally my favourite ever hostel. I have never been anywhere that hits every single nail on the head. When chatting with the owners they are proud of the research that have put into travelling the world's best hostels and amalgamating it all into this one Manila hotspot. Firstly the staff are brilliant, always smiling are truly helpful. Then the facilities are great, always clean and the private rooms would be more than acceptable in most 3 star hotels. Thirdly the food they serve is more than lovely at pretty standard pricing. The most important thing though, and it is what most travellers are after over the cheap prices of hostels, is the atmosphere. Enter the roof top bar. This 6th floor gem has a panoramic view over the city, great music and cheap drinks. It is the perfect location to start your adventures (and that there are plenty available) in Manila!",

    "detail": "I stayed at The Herritage for 3 nights and was tottally surprised at the level of service at the hotel. I stayedin a club room and got it super cheap through agoda, and with all the extras included in club, made our stay something we wont forget. Although like some hotels in manila the view from the balcony wasnt anything to brag about, but was nice to have a Balcony all the same because there are not many hotels in manila that do . It is close to SM Mall and everything you need. I highly rate this place and encourage to try the super value for money .",
