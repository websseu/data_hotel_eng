The hotel was immaculately clean and the room / cabin is sufficient for few nights as it is minimalist approach but still well executed. Towels, pajamas, safe for your valuables, slippers and comfortable bed even for me 1.88m tall guy. The folding doors are not really sound proof but when respecting the no talk on the phone rule and when you put your mobile to silent mode than it is o.k. Yes you will hear people walking down the corridor but this is the price to pay for this kind of accommodation but as traveler I always have ear plugs as they are number one necessity, even in some hotels. Bathrooms and shower facilities are amazing as the cleanliness and layout including the toiletries are well matching some five star hotels. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to stay Japanese style for relatively cheap money and experience something different. ",

The service provided by the hotel staff is most excellence. For those who had rent a car, the staff will clearly advice you where to park the car and the parking charges will be cheaper than the charges from the public parking nearby. The breakfast provided daily are limited choice however I love their coffee without milk. All the hotel staffs are very polite and have treated their customer with full respect.

The staffs at the front desk are nice and helpful, there is a free welcome ice-stick that you can get at the counter as well as slipper etc. The room is super quiet and clean with a mini fridge and shoe shelves. There is a nice common room with long work table, pantry bar and smoking room beside. It looks cool. In the washroom there is toilet, washing counter, make up desk and access to the shower room- shower gel, shampoo and conditioner is included. Clean and proper. Although quite some people staying, I don't feel too crowded, this is a very comfortable stay. Also it's just right besides the pier, harbour walkway and hilton hotel. The American village is just walkable!!! Alot of lovely souvenir stores and restaurants there, also a museum and beach on the other side. I shall have booked at least one more night here!! I would definitely come again if there is chance I visit Okinawa in future.",
