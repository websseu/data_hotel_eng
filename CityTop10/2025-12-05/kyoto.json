The room is just a bed with all the remote & key being the Ipod that was passed to you during check in. The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat. Cups & plates are also provided but do remember to do your own washing once you are done.",

    "detail": "Best hostel per budget so far I’ve been to in Japan. You get fridges to store food, kitchen to cook, coin laundry and locker to store small valuables. Downstairs is a cafe where you can eat all day, Nepali chicken curry is very good. Note that you make your own bed. For access, take Keihan train to Kiyomizu-Gojo station and walk here, or JR train to Kyoto station and take the bus 86, 100 202, 207 to Gojozaka bus stop. The hostel is near Gion area and the entrance pathway to Kiyomizu temple. Other attractions are easily reached by bus and I suggest buying 600 yen one day bus pass from the hostel staff if you will ride the bus at least three times in one day, except for Fushimi Inari which is much easier to get to by train. For food, head left towards Gion direction for about 300 metres, there’s a 24 hr Fresco supermarket which sells much cheaper stuff than convenient stores.",

    "detail": "I booked the superior capsule and it's the best capsule I had so far in Japan. Unlike most capsule, I don't need to check out of my room if I stay for multiple nights here and there's also option to choose for cleaning service for the superior capsule (no extra charges). It's like a mini hotel room with your own desk and door and bed... but without a lock. To me that's good enough because the price is great! Bed wise is very comfortable, not too noisy with a huge TV screen. It's comparable to a sky suite. Locker is huge enough for you to put your luggage in as well as your bags and others items (you have upper and lower storage space in the locker). The capsule although within about 5-10 mins walk from train station, its location is great as situated opposite Takashimaya and the most happening street in Kyoto and next to Gion. I will definitely come back here again to stay if I want save some costs on my accommodation in Kyoto and yet comfortable enough.",

    "detail": "Matsumoto Ryokan was a convenient stay for 2 nights in Kyoto. I was looking for a traditional ryokan type of stay in Kyoto and this is more on the budget end of what's available (but still kinda pricey). Finding it was easy: it's literally across the street from the Kyoto Station. I got to Matsumoto before check in and was able to leave my bags there while I explored Kyoto and came back. It was exciting to stay in a traditional type of accommodation. Although it was more of a no frills kind of place, with slightly outdated details and basic room and not really traditional decor, etc, it still felt nice and the room was quite spacious all for myself. I had a comfortable sleep and was grateful there's a bathroom in the room itself. The staff tried everything to be helpful and accommodating. Even after check out, I left my bags for a while to explore before heading back to Tokyo. It was so easy to get around Kyoto from here and would stay here again.",
