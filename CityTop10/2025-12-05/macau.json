    "detail": "we reach macau after 6 days stay in hong kong and travel to macau for another 3 days holiday. we reach macau ferry terminal and easily we are able to see a lady standing at the exit of the ferry terminal showing venetian macao resort hotel and directed us to the free shuttle service. before taking the free shuttle, i had tried to queue up at the macau ferry when i arrived for the purchase of ticket (turbo jet) back to hk, and end up, after half hours, the queue is still non moving. so,i back to the hotel, and through their great concierge service. we are able to book our ferry ticket (cotai jet) back to hk in advance without any hassle. once we reach the hotel, we are welcome and directed to the check in at the south lobby. we are expecting that it will be a slow process or long queue, due to these hotel having 3000 rooms! however, we are surprise of check in within 5 minutes, and was being shown to our hotel room. we are even being offered 2 welcome drink & 1 free 4r photo! our requisition of baby cot & high floor is being meet as well. we shops inside the hotel itself, and we walk till drop coz of the great varieties, though the shops price is a bit higher than outside. we did join the half day tour around macau and at affordable rate at mop98/ppl. its surprised that with mop98/ppl, we are able to see 15 highlight place of macau. a great tour to join! during our check-out, we did keep our luggage at the baggage center and when we did a claim at our baggages, the staffs offer to help us trolley our baggage to the free shuttle waiting for us to cotai ferry terminal. if i were to come to macau again, i will definitely stay in the venetian macao resort hotel and will recommend my friends to there too... p/s : the next time, i will visit the casino, and i had missed it this time due to time constraint on shopping! :) ",

    "detail": "Sheraton Macau was a surprise to me. I am the type who reads hotel reviews first before I book. I chose the Club King with Lounge access because buffet breakfast is included (just being practical). Fortunately, it also comes with an afternoon snacks and evening cocktail which for me is a big big plus. When we entered the lounge, we were greeted and attended to immediately by one of the hotel staffs (great job Alfie Rocamora). Staff like him is an asset to the company, very efficient so our check in was fast. Everything was explained, he knows what the guests need to know. We were able to check in at 130pm and was allowed to check out 1pm the following day (i have never experienced this with other 5 star hotels in Macau...only with Sheraton). We were also upgraded to a Cotai View room (what more can you ask for?). The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was really nice. Outdoor pools are beautiful but the weather wasn't good at that time. Temperature was still cold (19degrees) so we were not really able to enjoy, we just took pictures of the surroundings. I highly recommend this for the quality of the hotel and staff performance as well as the value for money. Overall, it was an excellent stay!",

    "detail": "Studio City Hotel is the perfect choice if you are on holiday with kids, but also want to enjoy adult things that a casino can offer. Studio City is a legitimate resort, with plenty of restaurants, amenities and fun things for the whole family. For kids there is the Batman Dark Flight simulator ride which is the best 4D ride i've ever been on. There's a WB Fun Zone which is a giant kids play area, comprising of multiple floors and can keep kids entertained for hours while you are enjoying the casino. Or can spend time with the kids. The giant pools with water slides, hot jacuzzis and a lazy river cant melt away the afternoon. In the middle of the hotel is the Golden Reel, a built-in ferris wheel attraction. Lots of places to eat. with the only complaint being that room service stops at 10:30pm. The room is very nice. There are two towers, the star tower and the celebrity tower. We stayed in the celebrity tower which seemed to be the less exclusive of the two. But it was easily a 3-4 star room. Has everything, great view and spacious. The hotel can be seen from the airport and is near the Venetian. It's a $50 Macau dollar taxi ride from the hotel to the airport. Overall completely recommend Studio City Hotel for any stay in Macau. You won't have to leave the resort at all unless you want to.",

From the moment we enter the hotel the front line staff Amad, greeted us and helped us on our luggage and led us to the front desk. Eva did the checking in which is fast and very professional she even greeted my parents a happy anniversary as soon as she knew it. Rose escorted us to the room, she told us all the hotel facilities and room amenities. Brian from the Concierge helped us with our luggage and provided some information in Macau. He also waited for us near the recreation to escort us to go to the lounge on eight. Lyn from the lounge on eight is very nice and engaging, the overall experience in the lounge on eight which is already very good is greatly enhanced because of her costumer engagement. Upon going out. Jury helped us on where to go, he gave us detailed information on which place to visit and which is very good place to go as my mom is having difficulty on walking. The room attendant, Sam, Dennis and Jonathan did a good job, service was really fast. Upon going to recreation Yumiko did a good job even we find it hard to communicate she tried her best to explain every facilities to us at the recreation. The gallery bar is very nice and cozy aswell, it has a very elegant vibe in it and is greatly enhanced by what louie made for us.

Price consider reasonable if you compare with other hotel in Macau. The location is in Taipa which is a newer town of Macau. They have free shuttle service but only once every hour. I find using their local bus service is very difficult as the bus driver are not that friendly. However, the bus will have some sort of announcement display in screen to show the next destination stop. Bus fare are cheap. In the end we choose Taxi since it is faster and more convenient. They follow meter rate. Approximately around MOP$40 for every ride to whatever destination within Macau. Consider cheap as Macau is actually a very smaill Island.",

    "detail": "Convenience place to stay in Macau & there are few vegetarian shops nearby within walking distance. I found 3 vegetarian shops which are less than 5 mins walking to their shop. Hotel provides shuttle bus to ferry station & you can actually take other interchange shuttle buses provided by other Casino Hotels to around Macau. Hotel has indoor swimming pool & a little casino as well. Price is very reasonable when you compared to other 5 star hotel in Macau. Public transport is 6 MOP /pax per trip no matter the distance (1st or last stop). Thanks Roy for the free upgrade to Deluxe room. Will come back again. ",

    "detail": "I didn't expect tk stay at such a beautiful hotel at this price! HK and Macau hotels are quite overpriced, but I think Harbourview hotel is not. First of all, it's really close to ferry station 5min by shuttle bus and Sands macau hotel 2min by walk where u can take the suttle bus to Venetian hotel, ferry station, and other casinos. Rooms are antic and beautifully designed. The shower booth and bath are perfect and all the soaps are Loccitant products. On the first floor, there is Goudiva shop where u can buy the wonderful chocolate icecream and drinks. I didn't have breakfast there, so can't judge it, but the rest of the service was perfect. ",
