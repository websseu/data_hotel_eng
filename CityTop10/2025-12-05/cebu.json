    "detail": "This is one of the best hotels in Cebu. Location is strategic near shopping centers and restaurants. The building is new that is why everything is at its best quality from the facade to hotel room as well as the swimming pool and gym. Restaurant for breakfast which is abaca serves very satisfying spread of buffet breakfast. What really made our stay memorable is the warm hospitality and customer service is excellent. I want to commend Mr. Mark one of the concierge for a job well done. I am also in the hospitality industry and I can say that Citadines Cebu had met my expectations in every aspect of hotel operation. Thank you very much for the pleasant experience and I hope the service quality will not change in the future. Keep up the good work Citadines Cebu! ",

    "detail": "i originally planned on staying at the quest hotel for a week, but ended up staying a month. value for money when i was here in may-june 2012 the value for money was incredible. i paid around us per night without breakfast. by comparison, the cebu marriott, was running around us per night – a little over twice the price, and i imagine no better quality. i looked at half a dozen hotels in cebu before settling on quest. other hotels in cebu running in the $50 - $60 range don’t even come close in terms of quality. and my high expectations were met after i moved in. location the location is great, right across the street from the ayala mall, which is the most upscale mall in cebu. ayala a good place to hang out with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops with fast internet connections. (unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",

The service by the staff was amazing, room and housekeeping the best and food, off the charts. The best breakfast buffet ever and I'm serious, the Cafe is the best. If you want an experience like never before visit the Twighlight Rooftop Lounge. Keep up the great work Bai Hotel, I will be back again and again when I return to Cebu.

And the room deco is spotless. If you took photos, you could use them in a brochure to advertise condos or something And unlike many CEBU hotels, a hot shower is available at any time of night or day. How many times have I found only cold water in the later evening - including the Bayfront hotel. So many hotels here go so far as to only turn on their water heater between ~7 and 10 AM Area is fine, unless you need to be close to the airport for an early flight. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They'll give you directions to stuff and also warn you if you'll end up in a seedy area.",

    "name": "Cebu Parklane International Hotel",
    "detail": "I have stayed at Cebu Parklane several times now. I have also stayed in The Waterfront Lahug and other Cebu hotels such as Century Park Plaza. However, the Parklane remains my favourite as it gets the balance right between value for money and comfort. The hotel is friendly. The restaurant is very good. The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",
