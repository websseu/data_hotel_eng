The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

    "detail": "This is a late review, but I still remember every detail of my stay at Putahracsa. From the moment you step in the lobby the staff would welcome you with very friendly and genuine smiles. They are not shy to approach their customers to help out and definitely did their best at servicing their customers. Any requests you'd make they did their best to help out. The service was definitely a major factor for me enjoying my stay so much. Secondly, the hotel itself was very nice and relaxing. The environment was quiet and private with two beautiful pools. The rooms were comfortable and large. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the hotel was situated on two sides of the road. So to get to the second pool from my room I had to cross the street to the other side. This is only a minor problem tho as there was always a staff member near the street to help you cross the street. Other nice things about the hotel include the free DVD's they provide which is great for night time as Hua Hin is not a big party/nightlife kind of town. The hotel also has a tuk tuk which you can book to take you from the hotel to anywhere in Hua Hin. Although taxi's in Thailand aren't too expensive anyway, having this service saves you from the hassel of finding a taxi yourself. The hotel's location is also pretty good as it is within walking distance to the night market. (which I would deem as one of the major attractions in Hua Hin)",

    "detail": "I came back to this hotel after a couple of years, as I remembered this is one quality hotel in Hua Hin and it still delivers exceptional service as the same. I stayed during the week to avoid too many people, which is work because it was so calm (last time I booked it was a bit busy as in high season). My room get upgrade to pool view on 4th floor which is great, thank you to the staff, the building facing the sea but I couldn't see as the floor is too low. The hotel has good facility which is well maintained, and amenities in room are all comfortable, I wanted to extend my stay but I might need to check out and wait for check in time, so I pull back the idea. Breakfast are nice, I'm still impress with various choice and presentation of buffet line. Staff are also very attentive, from the entrance to the lobby and all area in the hotel. The down side would be the distance from town and away from beach, I drive so there's no problem. I definitely will come back again.",

I haven't seen the swimming pool this size (and a lot of complex design) inside the hotel before. The room is quite spacious. The breakfast is full of variety of selection from everywhere. And above all, the service is really fantastic from the front desk, security guard (especially the one at the sea gate), and room service. So far, we haven't tried lunch and dinner there yet, but we will definitely be back there to test it for sure. ",

    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

    "detail": "We stayed here during the long weekend (Mother's Day in Thailand). We are lucky to get a very good deal from Agoda because hotels in Hua Hin is quite expensive. We booked since 17Jul13 and check in on 10Aug13. Recommend everyone to stay here because this hotel is clean, safe, staffs are friendly and there are swimming pools right next to the beach. Also Cecada Market is in walking distance (5 minutes walk only). We will go back there again if we go to Hua Hin.",

    "detail": "We found Hisea Hua Hin Hotel by chance when we we're talking to a local across the street from the hotel. We told her that we're searching for another hotel to stay at for the remaining 3 more weeks of vacation in Hua Hin. She immediately pointed to Hisea Hua Hin Hotel across the street which according to her, just barely opened for business. We decided to check it out right there and then, and we were lucky to meet the owner himself who showed us around. Hisea Hua Hin Hotel is definitely a jewel of a find, for its highly detailed facilities, tasteful decor, furnishings, amenities, friendly and helpful staffs, and for the price! Additionally, the location is perfect and within walking distance to a lot of Hua Hin's city center places of interest, and the beautiful Hua Hin beach! We've looked at many hotels in the area prior to visiting Hisea Hua Hin Hotel and nothing beats Hisea Hua Hin Hotel for what it offers, the price, location, and the staff. Being that it's brand new, it's absolutely immaculate! Although it's low season and therefore it's not fully booked, I see housekeeping clean every rooms everyday! The beds are the most comfortable we've ever found during our 3 months of travel in Asia, and the owner accommodates our needs to the best that he can. Case in point, I wanted an electric fan in my room due to my special need for it, and he happily obliged without question although the A/C in his hotel works perfectly. The staff are very attentive and helpful, and the owner is a hands on kind of a businessman. He's always around and can easily be reached and easy to talk to. Now, this is not the Hilton or Centara, but it doesn't have the high price of those 2 either and for all the quality service and amenities Hisea Hua Hin offers, it just can't be beat! Lastly, I would like to add that I have worked for big 5 star hotels in Las Vegas as a V.I.P. Associate for 5 years, therefore, I know a jewel of a find when I see one when it comes to hotels, amenities,",
