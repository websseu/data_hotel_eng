    "detail": "My son and I both really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Weil. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever tried. ALL the Staff are nice and helpful and service at every level and dept are ALL excellent. The room is very comfortable and also on the 10th floor room we had the view of Ipoh surroundings is very nice, and esp the surrounding limestone hills / mountains. Another big asset is the hotel is connected to the Ipoh Parade Mall which has many kinds of good restaurants. Note that the hotel and most others fill up on weekends -- evidently filled up because of local foodie tourists coming to Ipoh, even foodies from Singapore. Ipoh till now has its excellent food (reputation) basically everywhere. Ipoh main lacking though is ease of transport. Going out of the hotel is quite easy but not going back. So Weil Hotel location is a plus too since it is so central and many places are within walking distance. We got a local 3G data card for our tablet and used that to navigate the streets. All in all I think Weil is likely the best hotel in Ipoh now. Weil is setting the bar now for real value and excellent comfort. And then of course is the everywhere food in Ipoh -- a main everyday pursuit for excellent taste and tummy happy time !! ",

My family and I made a recent trip to Ipoh and had a good 2 night-stay at MH. Pleasantly surprised. We got the Family Room for RM350 per nite (RM390 for weekends and peak). May not be the best in terms of value, but it was spacious enough with 1 Queen and 1 Single Beds. We added an extra bed to cater for a total of 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids). Service was good - efficient and friendly staff. Located next to McDs and many other eateries, 2-3 minutes drive to AEON (Jusco) mall and just next to the entrance into Ipoh from the PLUS Highway. So, for me, I consider this to be location friendly. I have not stayed in other hotels in Ipoh, but I would certainly consider MH on my next visit to Ipoh.",

The bathroom was above my expectations and there was even rain shower. I called the reception desk regarding the hot water being lukewarm and help was rendered quite fast and effective. The staff were generally very efficient in serving guests. It is located not too far off the famous dim sum, taufu fah, white coffee places.

    "detail": "hotel: impiana casuarina hotel, ipoh. duration of stay: 18th may - 20th may 2010. group of guest: 2 guests. room type: 2 superior rooms. review: the hotel is the only true concept 3 stars impressive hotel in the city that one can find. it gives the guests a comfortable and safe feeling when checking in the hotel. the hotel facade is consider big although the old age shown, however once walking in to the lobby, the feeling of a large and granduer feeling over clouded the old aging feel hanging earlier. it has plenty of seats for guests to hang around in the lobby. it has enough space for children to roam about. the choice of food in the only restaurant is enough but can be better. however, the big swimming pool located at the back of the restaurant can do the justify. rooms are clean and adequate enough to be of hotel standards. all in all, i have stayed in this hotel and the only hotel in ipoh whenever i am travelling to ipoh for overnight business trips. surely a recommended 3 stars hotel to all travellers.

I just cannot believe that I only pay a little money to enjoy a luxurious stay at this hotel. Previously I only stay at this one hotel not to be mentioned whenever I have a business meeting in Ipoh. Well, that hotel has lost me as their frequent customer because from now on I will only stay at Ritz Garden Ipoh Hotel. Hope that this hotel will not going to change much but only getting better.",
