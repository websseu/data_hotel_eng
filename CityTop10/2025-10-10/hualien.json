    "detail": "I stayed for 2 nights at Herhuan hotel during my visit to Toroko Gorge (not very worth going unless you really appreciate rock formation) and Qixitan beach (one of the most beautiful beach I have been to), before my departure next day to Cingjing farm via Taipei (I came from Taipei anyway and had to go back ;). The room was spacious and had very good facilities. The traditional Taiwanese breakfast of rice and dishes is sumptuous and delicious, a good meal to start the travel of the day. The location of the hotel is very convenient, just next to the railway station; simply walk straight after exiting, turn right after seeing the first seven-eleven shop. And the main bus station to take the city bus and the one day tourist bus to Taroko Gorge and Qixitan is just next to the train station.",

They will try to answer any questions your may have regarding Hualien/Taiwan. Simple clean and comfy room. I like the sitting area where you can chill after a tiring day out. However, please take note the check in time is 3pm. I was there at 2:30pm and there were no person to attend to me. I could not even enter the premise. Perhaps that is something the management can look into. Even we cannot go into the room, at least there is a reception to allow us to leave our luggages etc.",

    "detail": "Location is very strategic and convenient because it’s very near Hualien station. Wherever u wanna go in Hualien, it has the best location to go from because most public buses and trains are all accessible here at Hualien station. It’s a green building hostel and easily spotted across from the station. There’s a cafe at the entrance of the building, or other alternatives like 7-11 is just a stone throw away. Beside the building is Hualien’s very famous Mochi Store which tasted superbly good. Hostel service was really beyond expected. Months before check-in date I was already contacted by their staff members via WhatsApp regarding on our itinerary and booking assistance whichever that we required. Or even just a simple enquiry that u may have about Hualien, they would be glad to answer or assist with. We managed to reserve 2 outdoor activities that we wanna participate in Hualien through their assistance in the bookings and the best part is we could make payment on our check-in date itself, without going through complicated bank transfers or emailing of personal documents. Through WoW Hostel helps to save up all the hassle and complicated procedures. Hygiene for the hostel is really, really clean. I have never seen such a clean hostel and their hygiene really impressed me. Facilities of the hostel is very pleasant and cosy. Very old school/retro vibe environment and simple toast and coffee provided for Breakfast every morning. Beds are quite comfy and sufficient space provided for luggages, adequate privacy and space if you’re staying in dormitory style rooms. Language communication maybe a bit difficult if you can’t communicate in Chinese, but some of the staff there knows little English so they will try their best to help u. Overall it’s super value for money, I will always come back here if I ever get the chance to travel around Hualien the next time.",

    "detail": "1) Very cheap 2) Walking distance to the inter-state train / bus station which is essential if you'd like to spend most of your time doing outdoor activities. Hualien's attractions are sporadic - so it is a lot more efficient to stay nearby the inter-state station than trying to find a place nearby some of the attractions. Plus, most of the main attractions are outside Hualien and you will need to take the bus to get around. 3) Very clean 4) The staffs were very hospitable, excited and cheerful. I was very impressed with their customer service. I left a metal ear pick in my hotel room after I left which I could not care less, and the staffs called and even sent me an e-mail stating that they were more than happy to post it! A bit extra but hey, for a small hotel in a small town, this hotel has better customer service than some of the 4-5 star hotel I had been to. 5) You can hire bicycles for free! As mentioned earlier, Hualien 's attractions are sporadic - riding a bicycles would make your trip a lot more fun! I personally feel like a stay in Hualien is incomplete without riding a bicycle around the town - plus it is free!",

There is almost no space for opening the luggage on the floor. And shower is directly in front of the main toilet door, so have to be aware when bathing or the water will flow out onto the bedroom floor. Only four hooks or so for hanging.

    "detail": "Hotel is located in good location. About 100m away from Hualien Railway Station, bus terminal and Tourist Information Centre. Nearby are eateries, shops, convenient stores, restaurants... etc. Friendly and helpful staff with good knowledge of tourist spots and advices on public transportation. Clean spacious room with snow white towels and good quality toiletries. This is not the first time I stayed with this hotel, and it won't be the last time. I enjoyed my stay and very please with the staff performance. Until now, I have never thought of staying in any other hotel in Hualien City. Will be back to stay with Charming City Hotel, a hotel that I feel so much at home.",

Upon arriving, Nick will explain all the to-go and to-eat at Hualien with a photocopied hand drawn map. He will be able to assist you with tour bookings & arrangements. :) Place is clean and cozy, equipped pretty much all the basic needs for travellers. Bed and blanket are superbly comfortable too. ;) ",
