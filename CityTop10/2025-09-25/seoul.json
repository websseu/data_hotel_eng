    "detail": "I have been to Seoul more than 30 times and usually book this place because of its location. It is right in front of Itaewon station, very convenient in city center, good access from airport and easy to move around. The room is clean and has free and fast Wifi. They used to have Korean Sauna at B1F but now the size is smaller, I still enjoy it though. Their staff is there 24/7 and helpful, they speak English and Japanese too. Money exchange is also available at the reception. One comment I should make is the noise from the neighbors, since Itaewon is a night town in Seoul, there are many people at clubs, pubs, etc. around this hotel and it could be loud (even in the hotel room) especially Friday and Saturday night. Single travelers or young couple should be fine but it might be not suitable for the family with young children. Also in summer they have small swimming pool at 5F and many, many people from outside of the hotel visit, so the elevator could be crowded sometimes.",

    "detail": "We split our stay in Seoul into 2 locations: Myeongdong and Gangnam. I picked Dormy Inn Seoul Gangnam because of the free breakfast, free ramen, self-serve laundry facilities and convenient locations to where we would be visiting during our stay in Gangnam. We were really satisfied with the widespread breakfast. Food was delicious and plentiful with changes in variety. We found that by eating a big breakfast and the free ramen, we were able to save money on meals by buying one large meal a day at lunch plus snacks of course. Who can resist Korean street food and snacks! We did not try the onsen but we saw people using it when doing our laundry. Love the self-serve laundry! We had a 23-day trip visiting South Korea and Hong Kong. Packing less clothing and doing laundry during the trip saved luggage for souvenirs. Washing is free and a small fee of 2000 won for drying. The machine has specific settings for delicate clothing items. Despite small room size, we highly recommend this hotel!",

Also, we went to emart via exit no. 4 for shopping before we left for airport. You can also get tax refunds on non-perishable items at emart. Coffee shops, fried chicken stalls and eating places (even Korean beef) are just opposite the road. The interior design of the room is modern with shelves, storage, hangers and beds are all very handy with a feeling of your own house. This is the best hotel I have stayed after years of travel in Korea. ",

You can even do advance check in if you are taking authorized Airlines partners. Food is of no problem.. Breakfast spread offered by the hotel is acceptable. Only slightly negative.. pillows are too soft.",
