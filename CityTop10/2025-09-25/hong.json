    "detail": "I would say it is the Best Price ever if you would like to have a short stay in Hong Kong only for some good sleeping time every night. The location is fantastic. You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

    "detail": "My wife and I lived in Hong Kong twice, for a total of four years. For most of that time we lived at mid-level on the Victoria side, and we loved the view we had, day and night. There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

And I am so happy I found YHA, which is probably the best value hostel I ever stayed in. Opened in 2013, the facilities are brand new and very clean. There is a public housing museum in the same facilities, which explains the expensive renovation that YHA went through. It is a heritage site, really. Great layout and a great cafeteria with decent breakfast given the cheap dormitory rooms. Do not miss out to hike up the hill located just in the back of the hostel for a great view over Kowloon. Interesting location in Sham Shui Po - one of the oldest and more shady neighbourhoods in Hong Kong. But still only 10 minutes subway ride from the skyscrapers in Central.",

For the price you'll find it hard to beat anywhere in Hong Kong. Tons of great restaurants within a minute or so walk, and for the diehards that need comfort food, McDonalds is just around the corner.

    "detail": "I had an unexpected extra night in Hong Kong so chose this hotel as it is quite new and was cheap. The lobby design is nice and big, check in was very quick. Yes the rooms are very small, mine had a double bed that basically filled the room and the bathroom had a half bath in it, which may have been better suited for just a shower and the bed was quite hard however the room design was new, it was clean, quiet and was fine for the 1 night I had there. If I had to spend a single night in Hong Kong I would have no problem going back there. If I was in Hong Kong for multiple nights I would probably choose a hotel with a bigger room.",

    "detail": "A group of 4 of us stayed in the newly renovated family room for 5 days. Everything was superb! The entire hotel had strong air conditioning which is a blessing in humid Hong Kong weather. We were a 5 minute walk away from the Times Square shopping area and had extremely easy access to calling taxis (which are very affordable in Hong Kong or the hotel can call you a taxi if you can't catch one) or buses/vans/MTR stations. There is a Sharetea and McDonalds down the block for people trying to minimize their daily walking. Everyone overall speaks English well and are very courteous. They will ask you for a 1,000 HKD cash security deposit for the room and it will be a quick 5 minute process to check the room/ return it to you when you check out. Cleaning ladies are the sweetest and do a very thorough job (vacuum everything down to the last speck of dust) and the gym has great variety. Will definitely stay at Charterhouse again the next time I visit HK. Thanks!",
