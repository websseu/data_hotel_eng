    "detail": "Stayed in this hotel for three times already, and I will definitely come back again . The location is good, just across NAIA terminal 3 (they provide a free shuttle bus every hour from the airport to the hotel. You can find the buses at the arrival gate at the ground floor of the airport). There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

This was our third stay here, and the staff remembered us and made us feel so welcome. It is within walking distance of the High Street and a short taxi ride to SM Aura. Fantastic location. Worth paying the extra for the Club Lounge with its evening snacks and range of drinks. OK, so the swimming pool is small, and this may not be a child-friendly hotel, but these are minor quibbles. Best hotel in Manila, and I have stayed at a few.",

    "detail": "This is one of the pricier hotels in Manila as it's near the international airport. My favorite thing about our stay in the hotel was the rooftop view from the top floor of the hotel where the pool was also located. You can lounge there while enjoying the view. They also have a sauna and a gym. The staff was also very helpful. They immediately helped me when I got locked out of my room because the automatic doorknob needed a change in battery. The food at the restaurant was delectable. There's a Starbucks on the same building of the hotel and there are a couple other restaurants around the Resorts World area which are easily accessible from the hotel. This hotel accommodated our last minute booking because our supposed first booking at another hotel also got cancelled last minute. Anyway, this hotel turned out to be better than we've expected and it's a great value for your money.",

    "detail": "The hotel is modern and tidy. The rooms are a bit small, but not cramped. I have been in much smaller hotel rooms. Bathroom was ok, however the water was only luke warm. I did not ask them to fix it. When we checked in, I explained that I had booked 2 nights, but I would be staying only one night, and the second night my wife would like her friend to stay over for company. Initially, they wanted to charge 1000 Peso, but after a bit of chatting they agreed to waive it. After all, we were not having extra people stay, no additional numbers for breakfast. The one gripe I do have, and hotel please take note: I went to have a drink of water from the supplied water bottles, and it tasted terrible. I looked closer at the bottle and it said Natural Drinking Water. So that means Tap Water, or water from a well or lake. Now I have drunk tap water in Davao, and its clean and tastes ok, but in Manila?? No way. Bottled water is cheap, so why not just have distilled water?? Surely that is better, and safer for your guests. ",

    "detail": "I was impressed from the start, good easy and quick check in, a personalised visit by the manager with some cookies were a nice touch. The room was large and extremely comfortable. The beds were great and the pillows too, I had a great sleep. The little things, TV had a huge number of channels to use, tee and coffee facilities, even a wine bottle opener, nick naks in the writing draw to assist you from paper clips to stapler. The bathroom was big and clean. We dinned on the rooftop, the Mongolian BBQ was not the greatest but was good, more spices were needed and more veg's too. The service was great and the ambiance was excellent. Night time above the maddening traffic of Manila was magic. The pool was excellent, while relatively small it was adequate and refreshing. My daughter loved it. Recommend this hotel .. yes definitely. All the staff were great, guys out front, the front desk crew, waiters and waitresses, cleaning staff all were happy, smiling and accommodating. I have finally found a great hotel in Manila, yes I will return.",
