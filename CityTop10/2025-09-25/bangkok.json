    "detail": "Hotel overall was great. Staff was very pleasant. Only thing is the location I would consider very far from central bangkok. Takes roughly 20mins++ bts if you intend.to go from hotel to BTS Siam and longer if you intend to go to Jatujak. Going by Taxi would be costly. The hotel would be ideal if you intend to go to Mega Bangna as you can get there by going to BTS Udom Suk and then taking the free shuttle bus from there. Another thing is walking from BTS Bangchak to the hotel is quite a distance so I wouldnt recommend anyone with a family or have problems walking due to the inconvenience. That aside we had a pleasant stay at the hotel. Would be great if the hotel could provide a buggy ride (i saw a buggy outside which was never used maybe for decor only) or some other form of transport to pick customers up from BTS bangchak to the hotel and back.",

    "detail": "This was the final of the six places I stayed in Thailand whilst traveling around the country . I stayed here for nearly a week. This place is newly re-furnished and thrives because of its staff and location. The staff are great and look after you as if you are family. They give great information on both local and national places of interest and also drew me out maps on occasions on how to get to places! Spending the late evenings learning Thai at reception (well counting to 5) was an added bonus as well as the shopping/markets/ travelling advice that I was given. The rooms were clean and have lockers. The location is very central with a BTS station less than a minute walk away that takes you to major places as did the boat that I took. The hostel is also in a great location to get the BTS 40 minute train to/from the international airport. This was a great place to stay and if I come back to Bangkok again, this is where I will be based. Thank you.",

One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",

I would say Asia Hotel is the finest hotel and value for money I have ever stayed. 5 star service. Staff are patient and willing to go the extra mile. They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

    "detail": "A regular visitor to Thailand I stayed in the excellent Ambassador Hotel on Soi 11off Sukhumvit this time. I say excellent because the standard is exactly how a €40+ per night 4 star in Bangkok should be.The Ambassador is a big property with many amenities. The reception area is huge and the staff are friendly and efficient. My luggage was taken from the Taxi and appeared in my room within minutes of me entering my room.The initial impression you get when you walk in to the reception area is 5 star but the rooms put it firmly back in the second division.They are not bad but quite basic. Everything works and at this price you can't ask for more. The WiFi is free and strong but does require constant re-entering of passwords which is annoying at first but you get used to it. Room cleaning is efficient and flexible. Long low timber ceiling corridors give it a kind of old cruise liner feel. Restaurants, Bars, Massage studio, Gym, Tailoring shops, health spa and several coffee shops are among it's many features. And of course that great location close to everything. Some of the best restaurants in Bangkok are here.The very expensive but superb El Gaucho Steakhouse,one of 2 in the area, is right next door. For Mexican try the Coyote across the road. And round the corner the Firehouse serves the best burgers in Bangkok. An Aussie Bar also across the road serves up the traditional full breakfast. I would recommend the Ambassador as a budget hotel without hesitation. ",

    "detail": "I really enjoyed my stay here and am already booked to go back two times. This hotel is a splurge for me since I am traveling for a year but I still think it's a great value and so nice to have a modern clean cool room to come back to in Bangkok. After not having wifi for 3 weeks I literally sat in my room and got caught up with my writing and planning. I did think the food was expensive, and the mini fridge too, but I think it goes with a nice hotel in Bangkok. And it didn't stop me from utilizing both. The staff was lovely and let me use the pool for a few hours after I checked out. The location is great for cheap street food but the hotel has amazing food too. The buffet lunch is pricey for one person but really good. Nice huge television and very comfortable bed. Best sleep I have had in months.",
