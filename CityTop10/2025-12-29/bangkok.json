    "detail": "Choosing a hotel in Bangkok is not easy since there are hundreds of options. We visited Bangkok as first-time tourists and we stayed first in Arcadia Suites Phloen Chit for 1 night but we are not satisfied with the location, so we decided to transfer here in Eastin Hotel Sathorn for 2 nights. Location is convenient because it is just right there in Surasak BTS. This is just one station away to Saphan Taksin where the Central Pier in Chao Phraya River is located. From this pier, you can take the Express Boats going to the Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Asiatique the Riverfront. This hotel is ideal if you are going to visit these spots. But if you are in Bangkok for shopping, I suggest you book hotels around Chitlom Station, near the Central World Shopping Mall and Siam Paragon. Room is spacious, clean, comfortable. The only one thing that is lacking is the toilet bidet. Our stay in Eastin is very relaxing and we appreciate the hotel comfort and ambiance a lot.",

    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

There were no reviews but we figured why not give it a go. The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part.

Roberson is nearby and so as all transportation. If you are looking to snack shopping, Roberson can fulfill all your snack needs. There were quite a lot of nice restaurants nearby and across the road as well. And there is an old book store nearby and it was a germ! I would definitely stay in this hotel next time. My suggestion, probably better ventilation before check in, it was quite hot in bangkok with the sun shine directly, no amount of air condition can cool the room down in an instant. Also, better television, it was almost impossible to watch anything, the reception was very bad.",

    "detail": "I am a visitor from Hong Kong and stay at Pullman Hotel G. Yesterday was my first day to check in to the hotel, Unfortunately I found my luggage was wrongly pick up at the airport. I was feeling lost and don't know what to do at that moment cause me and my girl friend doesn't speak Thai-language, also I don't even have a contact of my airline. So I went back to the lobby and looking for HELP. One of your staff which stay at Bell Captain side call Ping heard my situation and started help me to found out the number of the airline and talk with them about my issue. After all the conversation done, Ping suggest me to take the wrong luggage back to airport first and let BFS to handle my case. While we sent back the luggage and go to travel around, it was mid-night when we back to hotel. Another Bell Captain JoJo was there and I was asked for help to tracking my case. It was 8 hours later since I sent back the luggage and seems no luck on it as JoJo mention after he help to call the BFS. JoJo said he will stay connect with the BFS and let me know any update if need. Finally, BFS call me one hour later and said mine luggage was back to the airport and will sent back to the hotel I live! The next day I go back to Bell Captain, NJ saw my letter which provide by the hotel and already know what am I think of. My luggage is back! It's really amazing on all of you guys which help me on this ultimate-scared case and I think the training and the empathy of your staff are very well. I will recommend all my friend who will be BangKoK to travel to come to Pullman Bangkok Hotel G ! Also, a concierge staff call OFF also help us to contact the Van we book cause the time on my booking time is complicated. Thanks for his help too. Finally, i was received a cheat call from bangkok, thanks for your staff GAM to help me translate and let them know we are not worth to cheat. Again, thank you so much for all of your staff which helps. ",
