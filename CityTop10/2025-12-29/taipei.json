Hotel has the bare minimum (no pool, no gym) I need for my trip which mostly revolves travelling out to other areas in Taipei. + Toilet has a bidet + Both a shower and tub is present + TV channels were from a TV box and were more than adequate. + Hotel and rooms have a modern design + Attentive staff who replaced the shower and soap when we're almost done with it + Halloween decorations + blood (tomato) juice available at reception Conveniently located near Banqiao station which has 3 main lines - HSR, TRA and Taipei Metro. Makes it easy to get to airport via HSR (+1 transfer onto the Airport Line) and to Taipei Main Station. Located on the Blue Taipei Metro line, Ximen is just a few stops away. Breakfast is not an issue as there is a shop that sells cheap traditional Taiwanese breakfast right opposite the hotel. 2 Family Marts located beside the Hotel and a larger one located in Banqiao station which sells all the souvenir that you need (e.g. ChiaTe)",

    "detail": "I think that was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed, on the price I paid. Staff were very friendly, including the bellboy, the front desk staff and the housekeeping staff. Only the restaurant staff may need to have more smiles on their faces, but they were quick in clearing used plates and cups etc though. Room was very well equipped and the beds were very comfortable. It was well equipped and the housekeeping was very good, cleaning our room and replenished used items without any issue everyday. The only issue may be that the lighting was not sufficiently bright. Another thing I wish to suggest is that since it was a room for 4pax, more privacy could be done for the bathroom and toilet. The hotel has a small but nice gym with a coin operated laundry next to it. On the lobby of every floor it has a display screen showing trailers of movies besides advertisement. Breakfast was reasonable with sufficient variety for us. Only suggestion was that the egg could have been changed between omelet, fry eggs and scramble egg. Location wise, nothing to complain as it was just next to an MRT station with plenty of taxis waiting in front of the hotel. Ximending shopping zone is just next to it and the famous Red House is just across the road. Just to highlight that, as for most of the hotels in Taipei, the hotel does not have a parking area neither a covered front porch. You will have to prepare your own umbrella to get out of your car if it is raining. But the hotel provides umbrella if you want to get out of the hotel though. As your car will have to stop at the roadside which is about 30feet from the hotel main door, you will have to prepare to carry your luggage as the bellboy only wait in the hotel main door. Alternatively you run into the hotel to call the bellboy out to help. Overall, I love the hotel and it is highly recommended.l.",

Hotel is at the more expensive end of the range of Taipei hotels but I felt I achieved decent value for money all considering. Room for a couple was perfectly adequate, though did not appear as large as some photos I had seen in advertising. However this might have been due to the enormous bathroom taking a fair amount of the room space. I would neither describe the room as dated or modern, somewhere in between, but comfortable and always clean. Air conditioning was very good and quiet in operation. Breakfast was buffet style and comprehensive; I was very happy with it, the fruit juices were some of the best I have tasted. Staff need a special mention as they were consistently delightful, polite, friendly and always helpful (they could speak English though my partner can speak Chinese). Overall a very pleasant 8 day stay and I would visit again.",

It is a little from from Taipei station, but it is no inconvenient if taking a taxi ( taxi fare is low in Taiwan). Rather, a little far from busy street, we were able to stay comfortably, calmly.
