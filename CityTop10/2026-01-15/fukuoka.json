Rooms were clean with nice enough facilities. Staff were friendly, courteous and unobtrusive. The best part was the frankly lovely roof spa that was open all night and free for guests. Having a soak in the roof onsen in the open air after a night on the tiles was amazing. The only slight quibble I had was with the jammed elevators, only two to service the whole building, with the lobby placed on the 9th floor bizarrely. All in all though, I would definitely stay again. ",

That's so convenient for everything, what else you would ask for more? The room is neat and all basic amenity are all there. The room size is just right or I would say it's a bit larger than my expectation for a Japan hotel. The staffs are nice and helpful. There's also an iPad in each of the guest rooms so saving us hassel in bringing us along. I would say Forza hotel is just too perfect for a trip in Fukuoka or a North Kyushu trip having Hakata as the hub. Hihgly recommend this! :) ",

Fortunately, Hakata Green Hotel turned out to be a really great experience. The hotel was right next to Hakata Station, which is only two stops from Fukuoka Airport. I was a little confused by the directions I got from Google Maps because I arrived at the place that is marked on the map and it turned out to be Building No. 2, and then there's an Annex. Building No. 1. is part of the complex, though, so once I realized that it was all on the same block, I had no trouble finding the hotel. I'm not sure how much English support the staff is able to provide, but my simple Japanese was good enough to get by. Check in was quick and easy, and the room was clean and comfortable with good facilities. I slept like a baby on the comfortable bed, and then I had breakfast at the buffet on the bottom floor the next morning. Most of the dishes were European, but there were some Japanese style breakfast items to choose as well, and the coffee was delicious. Overall, I felt like the quality was just right for the price, and I would stay here again.",

    "detail": "You can start you Fukuoka odyssey at this cozy place. Decorous lounge at 9F: full of books along with maps marked with recommended restaurants and attractions to visit. They have provided kitchenware so you don't need to bring your own stuff (and you can surely cook over there, if you are saving money for buying souvenirs :D ). Don't worry about the shower rooms, they are nearly pristine at the second floor! Last but not least, the affable staff speak at least two languages among English, Chinese and Korean. (Japanese is a must I assume haha) To conclude, this is the place where I would love to stay if I go Fukuoka again.",
