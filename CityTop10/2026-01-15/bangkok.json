The staff of the Grand Howard Hotel was very welcoming. The hotelroom was big, clean and had all comfort you need. We had a corner room in the 17th floor and could enjoy a spectacular view of Bangkok because of the very big windows. My children especially enjoyed the big swimming pool in the 6th floor. Part of it is roofed (protected from the sun) so you can use it at all day times. But the most we loved the staff of the hotel. They gave us good advice about what to see in Bangkok and they gave us a warm welcome every time when we returned to the hotel. We felt like being home. Thanks a lot to the staff of the Grand Howard Hotel!",

There were no reviews but we figured why not give it a go. The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part. Room service food could be improved, but it was really cheap so I can't complain. The view from the high floors is quite nice so that was a positive as well. ",

    "detail": "I plan to return to Siri Sathorn before I leave Thailand and will make it a base for future visits to Bangkok. Quiet location, but easy walk to shopping, nightlife, Saladaeng Station and beautiful Lumpini Park. You can get a free shuttle too. All staff were very attentive, helpful and delightful. When my adaptor caused a fuse to blow, repairmen arrived within a couple of minutes of reporting it to recception and it was fixed immediately .Buffet breakfast and lunch were great. Gym is well equipped. But the highlight for me was my deluxe room, which was very spacious and comfortable and had a kitchenette as well. I got an excellent deal, which made it extremely good value for money. I visited friends in a much pricier Bangkok hotel and came away feeling I had made the better choice. I will certainly recommend Siri Sathorn to other visitors to Bangkok.",

    "detail": "This is my 3rd stay at this hotel and I can say with confidence that this is the best hotel in Bangkok. I had several needs that this hotel quickly accomodated. We needed to book some tickets to Siam Niramit and I inquired at the front desk, next thing I know we were booked and they wanted to give us directions which I already had. This is a soup to nuts hotel, if you need anything it will be done. The suite is a wonderfully decorated and functional room. It will not disappoint. Love the bidet toilet seats by Toto and the quality fixtures. The bar is a great place to grab a drink and enjoy the city view outside. The breakfast has just about everything you could want, but I try not to indulge too much and everything is just so tempting. I enjoyed the wonderful pool with a view. The internet always worked. The keycards never had a problem. I had numerous packages delivered here. I had several VIPs in Bangkok visit me here. Never a problem with them handling very expensive packages nor taking care of my friends who were always impressed when they came to visit. I didn't have to worry about them being rudely treated. So after all is said and done, don't even think twice about staying here. This should be your first choice, you will not be disappointed. I've traveled to Bangkok so many times and stayed at so many hotels here and this is at the top of the list.",
