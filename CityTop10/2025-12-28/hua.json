    "detail": "Though we live in Hua Hin we stay here regularly if we're attending an event, this time it was the local Jazz Festival on the beach. The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

In the room, there were lots of plugs for charging devices, plus robes & slippers, and the wifi was fast. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless. The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

    "detail": "We found Hisea Hua Hin Hotel by chance when we we're talking to a local across the street from the hotel. We told her that we're searching for another hotel to stay at for the remaining 3 more weeks of vacation in Hua Hin. She immediately pointed to Hisea Hua Hin Hotel across the street which according to her, just barely opened for business. We decided to check it out right there and then, and we were lucky to meet the owner himself who showed us around. Hisea Hua Hin Hotel is definitely a jewel of a find, for its highly detailed facilities, tasteful decor, furnishings, amenities, friendly and helpful staffs, and for the price! Additionally, the location is perfect and within walking distance to a lot of Hua Hin's city center places of interest, and the beautiful Hua Hin beach! We've looked at many hotels in the area prior to visiting Hisea Hua Hin Hotel and nothing beats Hisea Hua Hin Hotel for what it offers, the price, location, and the staff. Being that it's brand new, it's absolutely immaculate! Although it's low season and therefore it's not fully booked, I see housekeeping clean every rooms everyday! The beds are the most comfortable we've ever found during our 3 months of travel in Asia, and the owner accommodates our needs to the best that he can. Case in point, I wanted an electric fan in my room due to my special need for it, and he happily obliged without question although the A/C in his hotel works perfectly. The staff are very attentive and helpful, and the owner is a hands on kind of a businessman. He's always around and can easily be reached and easy to talk to. Now, this is not the Hilton or Centara, but it doesn't have the high price of those 2 either and for all the quality service and amenities Hisea Hua Hin offers, it just can't be beat! Lastly, I would like to add that I have worked for big 5 star hotels in Las Vegas as a V.I.P. Associate for 5 years, therefore, I know a jewel of a find when I see one when it comes to hotels, amenities,",

Staff very friendly, had to move room as extended stay due to enjoying time in Hua Hin and cleaner helped me move even taking out if drawer in 1 room and putting in same drawer in next room. Saved packing and unpacking into suitcase. Pool was nice, shame area around not so big and had to keep moving sun lounger to follow sun! But everything else made up for it! Definitely stay again!",

I stayed during the week to avoid too many people, which is work because it was so calm (last time I booked it was a bit busy as in high season). My room get upgrade to pool view on 4th floor which is great, thank you to the staff, the building facing the sea but I couldn't see as the floor is too low. The hotel has good facility which is well maintained, and amenities in room are all comfortable, I wanted to extend my stay but I might need to check out and wait for check in time, so I pull back the idea. Breakfast are nice, I'm still impress with various choice and presentation of buffet line. Staff are also very attentive, from the entrance to the lobby and all area in the hotel. The down side would be the distance from town and away from beach, I drive so there's no problem. I definitely will come back again.",

    "detail": "really nice hotel, friendly staff. the room was clean and spacious. there is a small but well-maintained swimming pool, with a few sun loungers along the side, which is nice to have a swim in after a day of exploring and sightseeing. The hotel is set back from the main road next to the San Paolo Hospital, which is near to a weekend night market,.and was there wasn't any noise from the road at nighttime. Although away from the beach and the center of Hua Hin it is easy enough to get around once you have negotiated the busy main road or hired a 'tuk-tuk' to take you wherever you'd like to go. I have been coming to Hua Hin for many years and now that I have stayed at VISA Hotel I will certainly consider staying here again when I am in this part of Thailand again.",
