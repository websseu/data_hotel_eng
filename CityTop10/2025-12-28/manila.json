    "detail": "Location, Location, Location... I’m Hotel is the perfect location for a 4 star hotel since it’s in Makati area and if your looking for central area to roam north or south of metro Manila, then I’m in the perfect place for you. So now let’s nit pick, room was clean and no weird odor which is a must. You even get a welcome cake when you enter your room which is a nice touch. Sheets was clean and didn’t seem worn so that a plus. Bathroom has a glass see through from the bedroom which is starting to trend amongst 4-5 star modern hotels but where I’m fails is the design flaw in the bathroom. The floor is flat so water starts to flood after a few minutes which is a fail. Also notice some spots the room attendants missed cleaning in the bathroom which is taboo for 4 star hotels. Shower pressure is strong and hot so thats a plus. Room service food is not bad either, fast and food was great. Roof top bar is fancy and that mixologist makes a mean bloody merry that is very rare find in Philippines. Overall I’m still comfortable giving IM HOTEL a 4 star rating. If you can get them under 5k Pesos or under 100 dollars a night then this place is really worth it . I personally wouldn’t go past that rate.",

But if you have guests who drive, then be prepared for a rather narrow, small and very limited car park.",

The location is good, just across NAIA terminal 3 (they provide a free shuttle bus every hour from the airport to the hotel. You can find the buses at the arrival gate at the ground floor of the airport). There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

The food at the restaurant was delectable. There's a Starbucks on the same building of the hotel and there are a couple other restaurants around the Resorts World area which are easily accessible from the hotel. This hotel accommodated our last minute booking because our supposed first booking at another hotel also got cancelled last minute.
