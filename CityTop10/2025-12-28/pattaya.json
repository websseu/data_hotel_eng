The best part of this hotel is their security. we had to declare ( with passport) every single person who is staying in each room. The security guy was always in front watching us even till 6am. The location was superb. Right at the center of pattaya beach road on soi 7. There were many bars in the same road. we also rented bikes from a shop jus opposite to the hotel. Familymart was just opposite the hotel entrance. t.t money exchange was close by on beach road. superb burger stall next to hotel only open at night. the room was jus nice. bed was hard. bathroom door had a see through glass panel. wifi was superbly fast and good. there was only 1 power point in the room and 2 more in the bath. no door bell. shower was hot and pressure was good.the pool was great with a great view. breakfast was average. staffs were very friendly professional and helpfull.

I didn't use the restaurant so can't comment. Pool is at the back with no views, & the gym is small with not a lot of equipment. They could make fine use of the hotel roof with a roof top bar which would have sensational views over Pattaya (try next door at the Seven Zea Chic hotel). Staff were friendly & efficient.

    "detail": "On my conquest of travelling around the world, having visited Pattaya multiple times, this is the hotel that stands out, being a hotel that deserves recognition and writing a review for. If I could, I would rate it a 5 star hostel, not a 2.5 star like humbly mentioned. It really exceeds my expectation. I believe that everyone who visits Pattaya for the first time should visit, you will not regret it and will definitely come back to visit again. Trust me, I’ve been there. My experience: I came to this location through google maps, but the sign is easily noticeable and you will appreciate it as it is just next to a large department store in the area; Royal Garden - I find it very valuable for a small hostel to be so easy to navigate to in the busy streets, and the convience of being able to get everything just nearby. My friends and I usually have the problem where, early in the morning, the quality restaurants are not yet opened and the street food are believed to be unclean. This hostel is just above a McDonalds which is open for 24hrs, so it solved all our problem concerning food :) We came here late at night so we did not see the view of the sea that clearly, but in the morning, we saw the sun rise just above the sea and I find that an experience to share. It is a must see for everyone who comes to pattaya. Before I booked, I checked the relative prices of nearby hotels which is much more expensive for a single room, but the reason I chose this hostel is because it is newly opened, fingers crossed as I booked, turns out a choice worth the risk and unbelievably clean! Do you understand the feeling of a new hotel, where everything from the toilet seats are brand new, white and clean! This is exactly my experience. The attention to detail is all cared for, clean new beds and pillows! Last but not least, the Wi-Fi, so damn fast, so speedy. Almost no delay in streaming Euro 2016.",

    "name": "OZO North Pattaya",
    "detail": "Newly opened hotel in North Pattaya since October 1st, 2020. The hotel is situated right before Amari hotel and within a short walking distance to Terminal 21 and the beach. We booked city view and had asked for a connecting room in which they then placed us on 14th floor room; overlooking Termninal 21 and some green area view which was good for us. Rooms were clean and well equipped with plenty of plugs and USB chargers. Amenities are Breeze, the same brand as Amari hotel. Fitness is opened 24 hours and located on 3rd floor of the building. It is one of our most impressive facilities as the room is big and has a full range of weight training equipment and machines. Swimming pool is also another stunning facility with perhaps 40-45 meter in length. They got kids' slider in the other pool too. Breakfast area is in EAT restaurant and it is huge. They also offer gluten free roll. We think, with a full capacity, this hotel should also be offering interesting breakfast lines. The Chill room offers board game, domino, cards, pool table, access to the Apple computer, etc. and also opens 24 hours. Parking is also good; indoor and plenty but not sure if with full capacity, it would be enough. Though the hotel has got outdoor spaces which should be fine. Overall for this trip, Ozo is in a good condition and offers reasonable prices and perfect facilities. ",
