    "detail": "This hotel is AMAZING!!! I fell in love with the pictures at first, but once I arrived there I was in AWE. It’s brand new, (only been one month since opening) so everything is white, clean and beautiful. I initially chose the standard capsule cause it was so cheap, but my friend and I upgraded to the deluxe oceanfront capsule which was not that substantial of a price difference. It was amazing waking up to the beach view in the morning! The rooms are not that expensive either, especially the capsule rooms. When you check in, the friendly staff politely prompts you to take off your shoes before entering, it’s a no shoe zone indoors. They provide you with an electronic room key that gives you access to the elevator and your locker, which upon opening receive a nice care hotel package of pajamas, towels, tissues, a mini razor, and a small water bottle. It’s very modern which is nice. What really sold me was the karaoke system that’s in the lobby cafe area, it’s free to use as a hotel guest. The owner is super friendly and cool, he owns a very well known karaoke bar chain that is located in several areas in South Korea apparently. That’s why the karaoke sound system is such nice quality. I absolutely loved singing to songs overlooking the beach! I anticipate the karaoke being a popular thing amongst hotel guests in the busier summer months. The decor of this hotel is exceptional. Full window oceanfront views, squeaky clean white floors, gorgeous modern interior design is only a minor detail of this beautiful hotel. I loved being able to look at the beach waves while eating breakfast in the hotel cafe. The Room Rates are very reasonable for the quality, grace, and luxury of Gwanganli Hotel 1. It felt like paradise staying here. This hotel stay is a must if you ever visit Gwanganli beach in Busan!!!",

    "name": "Toyoko Inn Busan Station 1",
    "detail": "The location is superb, just across the road from Busan KTX Exit 1 where there are small eateries and 24 hrs convenience stores. At Level 1 of the hotel lobby, there are 2 washers & dryers (beside the toilets) which is a plus factor and there is drinks vending machine, water dispenser, ice dispenser and microwave. The 2 of us stayed in the twin bedroom at 20th floor for 3 nights. The hotel room and bathroom is small and we can only open our L-sized luggage on the bed, but everything we need is there and the room is clean. But when we want to request for additional pillows, we can only ask for maximum 1 extra pillow per room. And when we have some issues with the washer & dryer, we tried to approach the counter staff for help but they cannot offer any help or assistance at all, which is pretty disappointing. Overall, the experience is good, room is clean, really easy to reach both Busan KTX and Busan Station Line 1 metro subway (Tips: There's a lift in between exit 4 and 6 if you are too tired from climbing stairs). Staff needs to improve on service standard as they were pretty cold and nonchalant attitude towards us.",

    "name": "Blueboat Hostel Haeundae",
    "detail": "The place was very easy to find and was conveniently near the subway station and bus stops. It was really close Haeundae beach and the traditional Haeundae market, which I highly recommend visitors to go. There were plenty of restaurants and convenience stores around. There was also a massive Daiso and a CGV movie theatre close to the place. However, Haeundae, in general, is quite far from the city centre of Busan, but it shouldn't be a problem since transportation (buses and subways) are really accessible from the guesthouse. The place is well maintained and the facilities available are modern. I love the interior of the place, it's very welcoming and pleasing. What you see on the pictures is what you get in real life. However, the bathroom stalls were quite unusual for me since the divider was only a semi-see-through glass, but it wasn't a big deal since I took showers when no one was around. Breakfast was included in our stay which was a massive plus. You need to be quick though especially if there are lots of other guests staying; the food could run out. The staff members were really nice and friendly. They were always willing to help us out. Overall, the guesthouse was a really good value for the price we paid. We enjoyed our stay in Busan and had an enjoyable stay at the guesthouse for 5 nights. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay near Haeundae beach and is looking for an excellent bargain!",
