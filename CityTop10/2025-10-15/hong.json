    "name": "Nina Hotel Tsuen Wan West",
    "detail": "From Sept 15th to 17th, I stayed in this wonderful Hotel together with my wife and 4 colleagues (we were on a company trip). This is my 3rd trip to Hong Kong and I must say although I paid much more for the previous 2 hotels in Hong Kong Island, but this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in Hong Kong or anywhere else! From the airport, we chose to take Bus no. A31 to take us to the hotel. The bus journey took about 55 minutes and we arrived at the hotel at about almost 8.00 p.m. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a very pleasant and friendly receptionist at the hotel who had so kindly agreed to upgrade my 3 original Standard rooms at Tower 1 into one room at Harbour View - Tower 2 (on the 85th floor!) and another Family suite room at the 82nd Floor for my 4 other colleagues! The view at both our hotel rooms were phenomenal! And I really loved my Harbour View room as the design was modern and nice and the King size bed was very comfortable. However, special mention needs to be given to the Family Suite Room here - it is Really Spacious and beautiful. There were 2 Queen size beds plus 2 single beds in the suite and it has everything- a fridge, 2 round tables, kitchen cabinets etc! I really think the hotel has been extremely generous to exchange this suite room with my original 2 standard rooms at tower 1! Meals were not a problem at all as there are very nice dim sum and chinese restaurants in and nearby the hotel. The Tsuen Wan West MTR station was also very nearby the hotel (about 15 minutes walk away) and during my 2 night stay there at the hotel, I did discover that the prices of food and other stuffs at Tsuen Wan were really much cheaper than that at Hong Kong Island. If ever I were to go to Hong Kong again, I will definitely return to stay at L'Hotel Nina et Convention Centre!",

It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It has al the mod-cons in the room including a massive LED TV with a welcoming message for you and even speakers in the bathroom. Going to this hotel also really helped as I arrived at about 1am in Hong Kong and so didn't need to look for taxis or late-night transport and then hassle with check-ins in Hong Kong City. Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

Yes the rooms are very small, mine had a double bed that basically filled the room and the bathroom had a half bath in it, which may have been better suited for just a shower and the bed was quite hard however the room design was new, it was clean, quiet and was fine for the 1 night I had there. If I had to spend a single night in Hong Kong I would have no problem going back there. If I was in Hong Kong for multiple nights I would probably choose a hotel with a bigger room.",
