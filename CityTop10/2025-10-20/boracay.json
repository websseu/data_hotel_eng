We were at the deep part of the water. Our safety had been compromised and the manager made us pay 5000 pesos for the paddle even though it wasn't our fault. The manager robbie and his people were very rude talking to us as if we were criminals. Never in my life have I been treated like this in any of the hotels I have stayed. The manager also insisted that he wanted cash and credit card was not allowed . We were suspicious so we only told him we will pay in card only and he got angry. In the end it was resolved by another manager which allowed us to pay in credit card and lower the amount to 5000 which is still very high(original amount asking is 6000). Very scam worthy. Would not recommend to anyone ever ",

It was a surprise for us at the moment we found out the shuttle bus to pick us up is from a 5 stars hotel, turns out Hennan Lagoon is a sister company of a hotel franchise, as a guest there we have free access to the 5 stars hotel's beach and a welcome drink at it's lounge. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The surroundings of this hotel is a bit noisy, but once you step into the lobby it become a different world, room is clean and quiet, swimming pool is well maintained. We had dinner buffet at their restaurant on the first night, food is ok. There are plenty of restaurant at the beach, which is only 5-10 mins walk from hotel.",

Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

    "detail": "We stayed 7 days 3 hotels while we were in Boracay to experience 3 stations (areas). We. 1st we stayed in Henann Primier (station 1), Astoria (station 3), then Crown Regency (station 2). Here our reviews.. POSITIVE: - Airport transfer from Boracay airport to Hotel 550peso for both of us, cheap & must have! Because there are no taxi to get to Boracay. Hotel representative picked up us at exit of Boracay Airport, then transported us to catch a fast boat to Boracay Island, and arrived hotel 20min later. - The hotel representative picked up us at Crown regency in our last day in Boracay!, and transported us back to airport (included in 550 peso that we already paid) - Welcome drinks - Good attitude & always smile staffs - Clean & new - Nice pool access room! - Cost about 70peso to go station 2, to enjoy more shopping & food. NEGATIVE: - Overprice outdoor activities. Should book it at the beach, it is much cheaper. Such as Island Hopping 800p, Zip line/ Cable car 900p, Buggy Car 900p & Jet Ski 2000p. Note: There are no Taxi in Boracay, only have tricycle & e-tric. Very cheap, cost about 70peso to 100peso. Thank you Henann! ",
