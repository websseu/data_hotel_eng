    "detail": "My wife and I lived in Hong Kong twice, for a total of four years. For most of that time we lived at mid-level on the Victoria side, and we loved the view we had, day and night. There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

    "name": "Butterfly on Wellington, Central",
    "detail": "We stayed in the Butterfly on Wellington for one night to break the journey from Melbourne to Paris. On our previous visit to Hong Kong we stayed on the Kowloon side at Mongkok, so we picked the Butterfly on Wellington because of its location on the Hong Kong side, and good reviews on TA. The location is excellent. It is easy to get to and from the Hong Kong Airport Express Station by taxi or walking. We went taxi to the hotel for a cost of 40HKD, but walked back the next day with our cases without any problems. The hotel is within 100 metres of the Mid-Levels escalators. The check-in process was smooth, and we were given an upgrade from an Executive room to a Butterfly Suite on the 2nd floor. Although close to street level, it was quiet and we heard no street noise in the morning. The room was large (it was a suite) and very comfortable. We were allowed to have a late checkout until 2pm, and then the hotel stored our luggage until we were ready to take it to the station in the evening. Both the reception and door staff were friendly and efficient. The Butterfly on Wellington is definitely value for money if you want a comfortable room in a great location without paying for all the other 5 star items you might not use, e.g. gym, pool, lobby, bar, etc. There were many restaurants around, so breakfast was not an issue. We would definitely stay at the Butterfly on Wellington the next time we pass through Hong Kong. ",

    "name": "The Mira Hong Kong",
    "detail": "Hong Kong is a mere 1 hour and 40 minutes flight away from Manila so it is a frequent destination for me and my family. We visit this vibrant city at least once a year and love going the week after Christmas. My first time to Hong Kong was when I was a 7 year-old kid and this was known back then as the Miramar. In recent years we used to stay in another hotel in Kowloon, but for the past 5 years we have been making The Mira more of our family choice the past 5 years. Every year we come back there is always something new added. It is super clean, modern and ultra chic, the bathrooms with glass walls, wi-fi everywhere...Beds are very comfortable. This is very important because in Hong Kong you have to walk a lot. (Choosing your hotel based on it being just to sleep for the night does not really apply to Hong Kong) I like the convenience of having a cell phone in each room, which allows the guest to make room to room calls; communicate with each other for free (perfect for families) while going around the city, and is an easy way to for people to contact you...certainly very convenient as we usually go our separate ways with my teenage daughters around; a money saver tool ; no need to depend on your mobile phone on international roaming! The Mira is across Knustford Terrace on Kimberley Road which has a Ben & Jerry's Ice cream on the ground floor, and an array of restaurants, and cozy bars, steak houses, restos serving Spanish tapas, Italian food,Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese restos; it's a great alternative for those who find the area of Lan Kwai Fong in Central too far , should you want a little night life. This place gets packed , yet this is what adds to Knutsford Terrace's charm. It is not in a typical building, and most of the bars /restos give the clients a choice of either staying in an open air area or inside. Really charming and picturesque at night!!",

    "name": "Harbour Grand Kowloon",
    "detail": "We chose this hotel as a friend in Hong Kong lives nearby. We had a twin room which had two double beds which provided ample space for my wife and I and our 5 year old son. The room was spacious by Hong Kong standards and the bathroom was modern and well-equipped with a bathtub and separate shower cubicle. The harbour view from our room looked out across to the old Kai Tak airport site and North Point/Quarry Bay on Hong Kong Island. From the ground floor restaurant and the harbourside footpath outside the hotel you have the 'classic' Hong Kong harbourside of skyscrapers which are illuminated at night - maybe some rooms have this view too! We didn't eat in the hotel as there are many restaurants to cater for all tastes and budgets within 5 minutes walk. There are also many local shops including a department store (Jusco) which also has a large supermarket and is located within a landlocked ship-shaped building. The hotel is served by the free Airport Express bus service (route K1) to Kowloon station to connect with the Airport Express train service to the airport. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to nearby Hong Hom MTR station and the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping area. If you miss the hotel shuttle bus, a taxi to Tsim Sha Tsiu/Kowloon Station area cost around HK$45 or the local Hong Kong bus route 8A from the Whampoa Garden bus terminal takes you to the Star Ferry Kowloon for a lot less! More information on local facilites can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whampoa_Garden The Hong Kong MTR is being extended to this area which will make it even more convenient once this is completed. I'd certainly recommend this hotel and will consider it for my next stay in Hong Kong.",
