    "detail": "This place is so hipster, but not in a bad way. Everything is so modern and every gesture and detail just blew me away. The bed itself was a bed/sofa that could be controlled by the ipod touch they lend you. The washrooms are ample and clean. You can book adjacent beds/units in case you're travelling with others. There's free breakfast in the mornings and free beer hour in the afternoons. Everything was top notch and everyone at the front desk was outgoing and spoke good English (this was a first for me out of 25+ hotels in Tokyo these few years). Next time I come back, I'll be staying entirely at The Millenials rather than waste my time elsewhere. ",

And also you'll find Tokyo New National Stadium - a landmark for Tokyo Olympic 2020 in front of the hotel. 1 min walk to Kokuritsu-Kyogijo st. (next to the hotel), 7 min walk to JR Sendagaya st. (also the nearest convenience store). They also have vending machine (snacks & drinks) in some of the floors, in case you wanna grab snacks or cold drinks at night. Definitely will stay again in this hotel. ",

Great location right by shibuya train station, friendly staff, small but cool rooms, and eclectic mix of hip clients, and most importantly bikes that you can borrow. One point, the slightly larger rooms are a hole lot more comfortable if you value your space, so book at least a modern double if you need to swing a cat. I've been to tokyo dozens of times, and stayed in scores of hotels, and when the client isn't paying for something more top shelf i always stay here. ",

    "detail": "Stayed in double bed room. Room size is what one would expect of hotels in Tokyo, quite small, enough room for 1 person to walk at a time. Bathroom was quite small too, but can't complain if you are able to shower and relief yourself. Hotel is about 300m walk from Shinjuku's Kabukicho exit, you can walk there easily. Along the way, you'll go past lots of eateries so you'll have plenty to choose from for meals. The place can get a bit lively in the evenings, mostly youngsters and young working adults will make up most of the crowd. So if you want a peaceful evening, you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a nice place to enjoy company, a good meal and drinks later. Finally, the staff, they were great. Accommodating, allowed me to leave my baggage there for a few hours before check-in and after check-out. Will stay again.",

    "detail": "Arrived very late at night from Haneda International Terminal through both Monorail & JR Yamanote Line, I had to spend around 20 minutes to find the right way from JR Shinjuku Station. However, it's inside Kabuki-cho, which is one of the best place to have a night drink in Tokyo. But also, the staff is very kind as they kept my 50,000 yens CoD order while other hotels in Tokyo would refuse. For French visitors who are not fluent in English, this is the right place to find French-speaking staff. The room size is correct according to Tokyo standards and it's equipped with Shiseido amenities everywhere. I would also recommend to have a delicious breakfast on the top of the hotel to get a wonderful landscape of Tokyo.",
