    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

It's now a bit faded compared to the new luxury hotels of Bangkok but I love it precisely because of its former grandeur - it has loads of atmosphere and above all I find it a really comfortable ‚Äòhome away from home‚Äô sort of place. The hotel staff are wonderful and have got to know me, so I‚Äôm warmly welcomed. Rooms are a decent size and nicely appointed. Good swimming pool.

They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

    "detail": "For those who have rated this hotel/serviced apartment complex as anything other than wonderful you are either on drugs or in urgent need of seeing a doctor. I have stayed at the Grande Centre Point (GCP) on four occasions now ‚Äì total of 32 nights ‚Äì and I remain convinced it is not just one of the best located (direct access to BTS, main Sukhumvit Road etc) hotels in Bangkok but the best value. Yes, it is not everybody‚Äôs budget but for those happy at $100/120 per night (there are days, but not many, when these prices are significantly more expensive) don‚Äôt waste your time looking elsewhere. If having shopping on your door step is a plus, then you have the brand new Terminal 21 shopping centre. And you if you want cheaper shopping then the extensive range of street stalls on Sukhumvit Road are just outside. If gym work is a chore to you, the hotel has tried to make it much easier with an extensive array of equipment (not some puny little room stuck somewhere in a corner as with so many hotels in the City) ‚Äì all with built in tv monitors. If you like a swimming pool and sun deck that is not just a paddle pool with some under-investment in sun loungers, then again GCP wins. And this is before you discover that there is a very generous area given to crazy golf and tennis. What other hotel in the City gives you these facilities ? Many of the great restaurants of Bangkok are on the Sukhumvit stretch, so you have all these within easy walking or taxi (or BTS) distance from you. Terminal 21 itself has many good quality eateries. For the ‚Äònight lovers‚Äô you have Soi Cowboy 100 meters away. Finally if there was a criticism I had in early stays at GCP it was the staff were under-trained but management have obviously put some time and investment into this critical service. So yes I can understand why some people will argue the case for other hotels in Bangkok (there are after all some magnificent ones in the City), they tend they tend to be in a significantly more expensive",

    "detail": "Hotel overall was great. Staff was very pleasant. Only thing is the location I would consider very far from central bangkok. Takes roughly 20mins++ bts if you intend.to go from hotel to BTS Siam and longer if you intend to go to Jatujak. Going by Taxi would be costly. The hotel would be ideal if you intend to go to Mega Bangna as you can get there by going to BTS Udom Suk and then taking the free shuttle bus from there. Another thing is walking from BTS Bangchak to the hotel is quite a distance so I wouldnt recommend anyone with a family or have problems walking due to the inconvenience. That aside we had a pleasant stay at the hotel. Would be great if the hotel could provide a buggy ride (i saw a buggy outside which was never used maybe for decor only) or some other form of transport to pick customers up from BTS bangchak to the hotel and back.",

    "detail": "I booked the first two nights of my Bangkok trip at Siam Eco - in the end I stayed ten. All the time I felt very welcomed - very nice staff, always smiling, hardworking and very very friendly. Super service - the helped me everytime when I had questions. I got a special breakfast, too, because of being vegan. The bed was very comfy - big and cosy. I stayed in the 8 bed dorm with the great panoramic window. The bathrooms where very clean and there were a bathroom only for ladys in the 3rd floor. In the common area you can relax, having your food or watching TV if you need it. There are mainly Asian people staying in the hostel, no party guests, so it was very quiet. The connection to get in the older city for sightseeing was very good. And also getting to both airports is really easy. If I'm back in Bangkok I definitly stay at Siam Eco again. ",
