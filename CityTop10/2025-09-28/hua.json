    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

    "detail": "This is a late review, but I still remember every detail of my stay at Putahracsa. From the moment you step in the lobby the staff would welcome you with very friendly and genuine smiles. They are not shy to approach their customers to help out and definitely did their best at servicing their customers. Any requests you'd make they did their best to help out. The service was definitely a major factor for me enjoying my stay so much. Secondly, the hotel itself was very nice and relaxing. The environment was quiet and private with two beautiful pools. The rooms were comfortable and large. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the hotel was situated on two sides of the road. So to get to the second pool from my room I had to cross the street to the other side. This is only a minor problem tho as there was always a staff member near the street to help you cross the street. Other nice things about the hotel include the free DVD's they provide which is great for night time as Hua Hin is not a big party/nightlife kind of town. The hotel also has a tuk tuk which you can book to take you from the hotel to anywhere in Hua Hin. Although taxi's in Thailand aren't too expensive anyway, having this service saves you from the hassel of finding a taxi yourself. The hotel's location is also pretty good as it is within walking distance to the night market. (which I would deem as one of the major attractions in Hua Hin)",

I booked sea view room but I got to stay on the second building which actually a pool view room and can see the sea from very far with the diagonal angle The room was very nice and clean with a huge king size bed, the rest room is not so big but the water flow is very nicely Breakfast, I expect ed to have a nice breakfast with the ocean view but unfortunately, everything is not hot, I am not sure how they warm up the food but it was cold except the egg menu because they fresh making it.
