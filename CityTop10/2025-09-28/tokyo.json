    "detail": "I travel to Tokyo every few months for business. This is the perfect hotel for that. Location is central, close to Ginza, Akihara, Tokyo station and only 15min to Shinjuku, 25 min to Shibuya. One step away from the metro station exit. Direct train from Haneda or Narita. Room is small but enough space (so do the other hotels in Tokyo), clean and modern. Bed and comforter is very comfy during the cold nights. Pillows are not like the western type that I know of (fluffy and kinna thick), they r very thin. But I get used to them. They provide enough amenities that you don't have to bring anything from home. Toothbrush, comb, body sponge, hairband are provided. Hairdryer, electric kettle with coffee and tea. They have the Japanese robe, yukata that I can use to sleep. So I don't normally bring pj. ",

Bathroom was quite small too, but can't complain if you are able to shower and relief yourself. Hotel is about 300m walk from Shinjuku's Kabukicho exit, you can walk there easily. Along the way, you'll go past lots of eateries so you'll have plenty to choose from for meals. The place can get a bit lively in the evenings, mostly youngsters and young working adults will make up most of the crowd. So if you want a peaceful evening, you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a nice place to enjoy company, a good meal and drinks later. Finally, the staff, they were great. Accommodating, allowed me to leave my baggage there for a few hours before check-in and after check-out. Will stay again.",

    "detail": "The location of the hotel is its best selling point. Couldn't be more convenient for those travelling to Narita airport by skyliner. The room itself is a little bit bigger than other Tokyo hotel rooms and for 1 person feels the right size. The bed is super soft which i thought it would be a problem but i have a suspicion that it is a memory mattress. Same with the pillows they are flat but again for me it wasn't a problem, as i got used to it within an hour. The TV screen is big with some Japanese channels and BBC world news that you can watch for free. Moneywise it was a bit expensive but again you are paying for the convenient location.",

    "name": "Shinjuku Kuyakusho-mae Capsule Hotel",
    "detail": "Everyone should try the capsule hotel experience at least one night when visiting Japan. So did I and picked this hotel based on the reviews on Agoda and couldn't be happier! The hotel is located in a 8 story building in Kabukicho, Shinjuku and it's very easy to get there. The reception is in floor 3, a common area for men & women with kitchen, restaurants, vending machines and internet café is located in floor 4. Floor 5 is used for day use capsules while the night capsules for men are located in floors 6 & 7. Women can stay in floor 8, separated from men. Staff was super nice and welcoming (contrary to some opinions here), they tried to help me from the very beginning and the people I talked to spoke fairly good English. Although customers are assigned a small locker with enough space to leave the clothes in a changing room, bigger luggage can be stored on some shelves present in both the changing room and in front of the reception. Don't be scared of leaving your items there, this is Japan and everybody respects your belongings. The place is clean and the capsule is much bigger than pictured!! Inside there is a control panel for the light, alarm, air conditioner and television, a power socket and a mirror along with the pillow and a duvet. All capsules have a curtain than can be opened/closed for privacy and but beware that some noises can come inside if other guests speak loudly (usually don't). The hotel also has a traditional Japanese bath (onsen) and sauna. Don't forget to try it before you leave! Checkout time is at 10 am and luggage cannot be stored after checking out. I had a great experience at Shinjuku Kuyakusho-mae Capsule Hotel and will definitely come back in my next trip to Tokyo.",
