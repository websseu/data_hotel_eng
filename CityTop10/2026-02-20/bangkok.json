One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",

The rooms are not as good as I thought they would be, already a bit dated which was surprising since most reviews said it was a new hotel. The breakfast was the most disappointing part, again weird because all the reviews said it was so great. The coffee in the restaurant really needs to change, it was actually horrid. Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part. Room service food could be improved, but it was really cheap so I can't complain. The view from the high floors is quite nice so that was a positive as well. ",

Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

This place is newly re-furnished and thrives because of its staff and location. The staff are great and look after you as if you are family. They give great information on both local and national places of interest and also drew me out maps on occasions on how to get to places! Spending the late evenings learning Thai at reception (well counting to 5) was an added bonus as well as the shopping/markets/ travelling advice that I was given. The rooms were clean and have lockers. The location is very central with a BTS station less than a minute walk away that takes you to major places as did the boat that I took. The hostel is also in a great location to get the BTS 40 minute train to/from the international airport. This was a great place to stay and if I come back to Bangkok again, this is where I will be based. Thank you.",

    "detail": "OK, it is rare to have a hotel in bangkok where smoking is allowed and it was quite a stay for us. It was very quiet hotel too so you can sleep well at night. It was not a bad hotel at all. For that price, I think it is all worthwhile. I would give five stars if they gave me bottle water the first day when I checked in, so next time, give me water! LOL... Roberson is nearby and so as all transportation. If you are looking to snack shopping, Roberson can fulfill all your snack needs. There were quite a lot of nice restaurants nearby and across the road as well. And there is an old book store nearby and it was a germ! I would definitely stay in this hotel next time. My suggestion, probably better ventilation before check in, it was quite hot in bangkok with the sun shine directly, no amount of air condition can cool the room down in an instant. Also, better television, it was almost impossible to watch anything, the reception was very bad.",
