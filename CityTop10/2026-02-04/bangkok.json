    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

The rooms are not as good as I thought they would be, already a bit dated which was surprising since most reviews said it was a new hotel. The breakfast was the most disappointing part, again weird because all the reviews said it was so great. The coffee in the restaurant really needs to change, it was actually horrid. Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part. Room service food could be improved, but it was really cheap so I can't complain. The view from the high floors is quite nice so that was a positive as well. ",

    "detail": "I've travelled to Bangkok numerous times and usually stay in Sukhumvit 11 and have stayed at at least 10 hotels in the area. The Citrus Sukhumvit is the best by far when factoring in all that it has to offer. It is far cheaper than many other comparable hotels and still offers similar facilities. The rooms are new and spacious and the internet is fast and reliable. Breakfast selection is as good if not better than some higher priced and higher rated places. The only down side is the small bar fridge in the rooms. They are absolutely useless. There is no way of adjusting any temperature and the best they do is store things. Nothing is cold. I have stayed here now 3 times in different rooms and with the same result in the fridge failing to keep anything even close to cool. Still this is a small price to pay when you balance everything up as you can easily walk down the street 100 metres to the 7-11 and get cold drinks from there. I'll continue to stay here as my hotel of choice when visiting Bangkok and hope that one day they'll do something about the bar fridge's in the rooms.",

They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

    "detail": "OK, it is rare to have a hotel in bangkok where smoking is allowed and it was quite a stay for us. It was very quiet hotel too so you can sleep well at night. It was not a bad hotel at all. For that price, I think it is all worthwhile. I would give five stars if they gave me bottle water the first day when I checked in, so next time, give me water! LOL... Roberson is nearby and so as all transportation. If you are looking to snack shopping, Roberson can fulfill all your snack needs. There were quite a lot of nice restaurants nearby and across the road as well. And there is an old book store nearby and it was a germ! I would definitely stay in this hotel next time. My suggestion, probably better ventilation before check in, it was quite hot in bangkok with the sun shine directly, no amount of air condition can cool the room down in an instant. Also, better television, it was almost impossible to watch anything, the reception was very bad.",
