    "detail": "there is nothing like a good bed to sleep in after a hard days traveling. we were so happy when we go to the v.l. hatyai hotel in hat yai. it was a measly three blocks from the hat yai train station, up a road that had perfect side walks for walking people. the reception at v.l hatyai hotel was fantastic. people were happy, smiling, and most were able to speak english. the language barrier isn’t normally an important feature for us but after a very long day in minivans, ferries, buses, songteaws and on our feet it was a lovely surprise. we had booked our night in the v.l. hatyai hotel because of tripadvisor’s reviews and through agoda, who offered a very good rate for the room without breakfast. the room alone cost just under $30 usd without breakfast. when we enquired about the breakfast it would cost us 100 baht each, a whole $3 usd each. it was a fine breakfast too. bacon and eggs, yummy bread for toast, asian savoury delights, the makings for tuna salad, coffee, tea and milo, and for breakfast-dessert, bbq’d sticky banana rice in banana leaves. mmm! as we were so tired on the night of our stay we got room service. this is not ordinary for us but when we looked at the menu in our room the prices were so reasonable we didn’t feel the need to find a street food stall! how could a room service tuna salad only cost 80 baht? unheard of in a hotel. we ordered room service, pigged out on glorious food and watched english language television all night. the only downfall the v.l. hat yai had was that you had to purchase wifi / internet. the cost was reasonable, 20 baht for 24 hours of usage. if you could get it working that is. we found that the wifi worked best down in the lobby. all in all, the v.l. hat yai was a fantastic hotel. we really do recommend you consider staying there for one or two nights on your travels. break up that marathon journey between thailand and malaysia. you won’t regret it.

    "detail": "I used to live in Hat Yai and this hotel didn’t exist when I was there. My friend and I found that it would cost us the same to get a double room and share a bed (split the cost) as it would to each get an individual room. We went with the single room option which was great because it only cost us about $9 per night (approx 288 THB). Loft bed, living space with couch, TV, and desk as well as lots of floor space. A box up in the loft area to store luggage, closet with drawers, lots of floor space, plenty of power outlets, and a fairly good sized bathroom (for one person). Powerful air con in the room and since they were inside rooms with no windows, lovely and dark no matter the time of day. Good WiFi throughout the building. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They have a gym and communal kitchen on the second floor as well as a lounge area. I would say the only downsides are that if you want extra bedding or towels or pretty much anything besides the one towel, pillow, and terry cloth blanket, you have to rent them. Not a deposit that you will get back but actually paying extra for them. Also, the steps to get up into your bed are quite steep with no railing. A little inconvenient for middle of the night trips to the restroom. It is located just along the Khlong near the Phetkasem roundabout, which makes it a good location for going downtown and catching transportation. All in all, I would definitely stay here again!",

    "detail": "Aloha Hotel is a brand new hotel well located in Hat Yai, and within walking distance to the major shopping belt & local markets, such as Lee Garden Plaza & Kim Yong Market. The hotel lobby set-up is simple and clean. We reached Aloha Hotel at about 10.30am on our first day in Hat Yai and were allowed to check in early. We were also able to have late check-out at 2pm upon request on our last day of stay. Both check-in and out procedures were swift and took not more than 5 mins each. The double bed room which we booked was found to be very clean and well kept, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, it is a good choice and strongly recommended.",

    "detail": "We spent 3 night in this hotel for our honeymoon. The hotel is average. We had a terrible experience when we request for iron. We already put a special request for iron during booking process a month before travel. The first night when arrived at the hotel, we request for iron but the staff told us need to iron at laundry room and the laundry room open at 8 o’clock in the morning so we need to wait for tomorrow morning and start our day late cause need to wait for laundry to open. Luckily when we go to the laundry room, a lady staff there was so nice, she iron the clothes for us and said will send to our room. And the best part was that she sent the clothes with the bill. She did not even mention that there was charges for ironing. And it was 38 bath for 2 pieces of clothes, 1 piece of shirt and 1 piece of scarf. The hotel also don’t have hair dryer in the room, mineral water in the fridge need to pay 30 bath a bottle, the aircond temperature was stuck at 22 degree celsius. ",
