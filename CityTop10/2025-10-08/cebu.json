    "detail": "i originally planned on staying at the quest hotel for a week, but ended up staying a month. value for money when i was here in may-june 2012 the value for money was incredible. i paid around us per night without breakfast. by comparison, the cebu marriott, was running around us per night – a little over twice the price, and i imagine no better quality. i looked at half a dozen hotels in cebu before settling on quest. other hotels in cebu running in the $50 - $60 range don’t even come close in terms of quality. and my high expectations were met after i moved in. location the location is great, right across the street from the ayala mall, which is the most upscale mall in cebu. ayala a good place to hang out with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops with fast internet connections. (unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",

The staff once again are considerate beyond belief, friendly and helpful making our experience very enjoyable. The food is great, the room service from Aaron and housekeeping from Jenny. Outstanding general attention and kindness from all levels of management and staff including a very warm and extremely hospitable Dazzle, Richard , Sabrina still a trainee but beaming with a promise. and too many persons to be able to cite by name but all of them outstanding and much appreciated. The hotel operators like Farah and Adel are both very helpful and accommodating. Another, impressive memory was during our latest visit when Rose, the business executive manager when learning that I was temporarily ill send her assistant to bring me Gatorade. The staff at the swimming pool have always been extraordinary in their attention to our needs and comfort which we appreciate. We are deeply indebted for the fine service at the pool from Charisma who is always been very kind and thoughtful in making us feel at home and comfortable. The food is excellent with new creations and innovation with their NEW OUTDOOR RESTAURANT you can really dine with the StARS and have Romantic evening with candlelight to make guests love the outdoor meals served including superior and premium steaks that my wife and I dearly loved,that WE DINE 2 nights in a ROW ! Lastly, Sous chef ,Joeffrey and executive chef Roberto Kunitz are wonderful in terms of their service to customers and are much appreciated by this customer and family. A hallmark of this beautiful restaurant is there breakfast Buffet which is the most elegant and varied breakfast buffets I’ve ever tried in my worldwide travels.

    "name": "Waterfront Airport Hotel and Casino Mactan",
    "detail": "For 20 years I have stayed 50+ nights a year in hotels in various parts of the world; mostly Europe and North and South America. I had used 4 or 5 star beach resorts on Mactan Island on 3 prior visits to Cebu. They were good hotels but had no soul. The staff were robotic - by rote answers to questions and, if something unusual was asked, the human equivalent of a computer page being unavailable. So I asked myself what I was looking for from a Cebu hotel. The answer was comfort, safety, a decent swimming pool and good transport links. The Waterfront Airport is what it says it is; a 3 star airport hotel where most customers will stay overnight after arriving or prior to departure from Mactan-Cebu Airport. However it is much more than that. I stayed in a Deluxe suite. This was actually three good sized rooms: a bedroom with double bed, TV and plenty of storage; a bathroom which had a bath with a flexible shower fitting and a separate shower room with a fixed shower; and, a lounge with TV, two seater sofa and 2 chairs, table, TV, mini-bar, two large windows giving views of the city and interior on one side and of the airport on the other, and more storage. Each room had a phone and air conditioning operating down to 18C. It made a quiet background hum causing no disturbance. Rooms are sound-proofed but planes can be seen and just about heard in the lobby area. The swimming pool is 28x12 yards and 3-4 feet deep throughout with a small area which is very shallow and suitable for young children. Complimentary towels are provided and there is a good quality gym adjacent to it. At weekend from 7-11pm a pianist and singer perform in the lobby lounge. Marina Mall is an 8 Peso jeepney ride or ten minute walk away. The hotel, although 3 star, provided terrific value for money, has staff who go out of their way to be helpful and I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality at a competitive price and a good base from which to explore Cebu, city and island.",

The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",

    "detail": "Everything is really well decorated, efficiently set up and the rooms are excellent. Clean, modern, cozy with very nice bathrooms, easily matching the Quest Hotel or Bayfront Hotel. + full suite of amenities: fridge, water kettle, desk, chair, safe-box, remote controlled modern Hitachi aircon, no less. And the room deco is spotless. If you took photos, you could use them in a brochure to advertise condos or something And unlike many CEBU hotels, a hot shower is available at any time of night or day. How many times have I found only cold water in the later evening - including the Bayfront hotel. So many hotels here go so far as to only turn on their water heater between ~7 and 10 AM Area is fine, unless you need to be close to the airport for an early flight. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They'll give you directions to stuff and also warn you if you'll end up in a seedy area.",

It exceeds all my expectations, from the receiving guards at the lobby, the security (they have a K9 dog at the lobby), the receptionists, the cleanliness and lighting of the room, the free minibar, soft comfortable bed and pillows, the infinity pool overlooking the city, the wide array of food they serve at breakfast, everything was great! It was a 15 minute drive from the airport, light to no traffic in the area, plus they also have a hospital adjacent to the hotel so God forbid, if anything happens, medical service will be readily available. I definitely will be choosing this hotel from now on and will recommend it to all who will be travelling to Cebu. :) Thank you Maayo Hotel. ",
