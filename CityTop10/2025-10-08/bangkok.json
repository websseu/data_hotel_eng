    "detail": "it was our 4th stay at this hotel. as earlier requested, we were accomodated to the same room in which we stayed before smoothly. among many 5 star hotels in bangkok we have stayed,we believe this hotel is located at the most convenient place and best cost performance. their christmas decolation was beautiful too. only one negative experience was that it was not well explained in japanese welcome letter that they charge for guest from outside to use executive lounge during cocktail hour.it only says we can invite one outside guest to the lounge. and it was explained unfriendly when we brought the guest there. so, we ended up to pay 250thb for one bottle of not-cold-enough beer for our guest which we found a bit expensive. else, we did like everything and definitely come back again.",

    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

    "detail": "Pros: 1. Super fast check in and check out (done in less than 10 minutes) 2. Spacious room for 2 adults and a kid with a 2-seats comfy sofa, work desk and chair, enough pillows and large bed! 3. Right in the middle of hustling soi 11, but rooms are quiet. You only feel it once you get out on the streets. 4. Accommodated all special requests made while booking. 5. Housekeeping was on point! Even organized our clothes that were left all around dangling. 6. Didn’t dine in so can’t review about the food 7. Large window with a city view and sunlight (rare find in this area) 8. Enough lighting, large mirror in the room, comparatively small but functional bathroom, necessary amenities were presented and refilled 9. Pool is nice and big 10. Very Helpful staff, called rides for us everyday within 5 minutes, helped as requested for other services. Cons: 1. No iron and iron board in the room as default option 2. Plenty of TV channels but mostly news and sports channels, only two options for kids and a few movie and documentary/lifestyle channels. No music channel. My kid felt bored. 3. Location, service and amenities- no complaints rather outstanding. But price seems a little higher for rooms if compared to other similar hotels nearby. 4. Bed mattress was too soft. Won’t bother you unless you’ve back problems like neck pain, spondylitis or backpain or used to ergonomic sleeping materials or is prone to body aches due to sleeping posture. Overall we’re super happy with their hospitality. Our 4 nights stay was great. Hope to return to this one sometime soon as Bangkok is a frequent destination for me. ",

    "detail": "My son (15), my two daughters (12 and 9) and me stayed at the Grand Howard Hotel for nine nights. It was our first stay in Asia (even our first stay outside of Europe). The staff of the Grand Howard Hotel was very welcoming. The hotelroom was big, clean and had all comfort you need. We had a corner room in the 17th floor and could enjoy a spectacular view of Bangkok because of the very big windows. My children especially enjoyed the big swimming pool in the 6th floor. Part of it is roofed (protected from the sun) so you can use it at all day times. But the most we loved the staff of the hotel. They gave us good advice about what to see in Bangkok and they gave us a warm welcome every time when we returned to the hotel. We felt like being home. Thanks a lot to the staff of the Grand Howard Hotel!",

    "detail": "We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while in Bangkok. The rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL, marble everything, great shower, nice tub for baths, free bath bombs, great feeling sheets. You definitely feel like your staying in luxury, but for such a reasonable price! The staff is very attentive and will rush to open the door for you when they see you coming back, carry all your suitcases for you, etc. For the price I don’t think you will be able to find another hotel in Bangkok that offers this much. The breakfast buffet was amazing, they had a western side and Asian side. In the afternoons they serve snacks available to the guests for free from 2pm-5pm which was nice. I would absolutely stay in this hotel again if I come back to Bangkok!",
