There are a handful of restaurants along the river front, and of course the ubiquitos Starbucks. Some are bars, some cafes, some restaurants. Just take yourself along for a wander and explore. It is a great view of Shanghai, seeing the Bund from Pudong s the best way to see it, especially if you settle down for a bite or a drink. All the options looked dcent, tho perhaps it can be a bit quiet. The hotel is across the road road from the Super Brand shopping mall. Getting a taxi is not too bad, but if there is either a queue, or you just don't see any taxis, then walk over to the mall where there is usually a few of them waiting on the corner. If you dont fancy the standard, expensive buffet breakfast, take yourself over to the mall to Starbucks, or Lavazza or one of the local options. There is also a metro station just a few minutes walk away. ",

I would recommend all guest to have a drink at the Vue bar to chill out. Being situated at Pu xi, Huang Pu Road the hotel is minutes walk from the Bund and nan jing road where most of the great, shopping, restaurant and bar located at. Very convenient location. As for the facility, Hyatt on the Bund provide better facility than other 5 star hotel in city. warm pool and great gym. I stayed at the club room on the east tower at 27 floor that offer magnificent view, the room is spacious and amenity is nice. I truly enjoy my stay at Hyatt on Bund and will stay here again come May Shanghai Expo. ",

The hotel has the best location I could ask for, 2 blocks from MRT in central Bund walking distance to Nanjing Lu and to all nightlife in the neighborhood. Moreover the room was quite comfortable, I was coming from Hong Kong and this felt like a 5 starts compared to those shitty hotels in Central. The staff also was super friendly and even bumped me up in the hotel. This is now my default place to stay at Shanghai and I look forward to the next time.",

We were very impressed with the quality, cleanliness, and professionalism of the staff. Booking through agoda gave us the opportunity we probably wouldn't have otherwise had to stay at this 5-star hotel because of the great value offered. Interesting to note that many famous people have stayed there previously, including Reagan, Thatcher, and Deng Xiao Ping. It was also very convenient to Metro's line 1 and within walking distance to many stops and restaurants. The staff was always very helpful in calling a taxi for us when necessary, however. The only slight negative was the fact that there are many entrances on the Jin Jiang site which can become a little confusing to new guests and taxi drivers; however, the staff was always available to guide and deliver us where we needed to go. We would definitely stay there again in the future - with agoda's help, of course!",

I prefer eat breakfast in executive lounge at 27 floor than lobby because of lot of smell from kitchen. Executive lounge bar open since 6:30 am till midnight and they serve there breakfast, lunch , dinner and all drink including good alcohol. Room clean and big and bathroom huge. Staff really really good ",

    "name": "Metropolo Xincheng Hotel, The Bund Shanghai",
    "detail": "Architecture and history buffs will love Bund Circle and spend hours researching its four spledid Art Deco buildings. The hotel interior is renovated 'Art Deco' - need I say more? - but the room we had was spacious and very well-appointed. The staff were very helpful indeed. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from East Nanjing Road metro station, that has connections to Pudong Airport and Hongqiao Airport and Railway Station. We can't comment on the hotel's dining room as we prefer to eat out. Down the road are local dumpling and noodle restaurants, and in the next block is Shanghai Grandmother - a bright and cheerful restaurant that sells authentic local food to tourists - not many Europeans, most tourists in China are Chinese. For many people, Jiangsu cuisine is China's finest, with its subtle, harmonious flavours and gentle (in Shanghai, not so gentle) sweetness. And next door is 'House of Blues and Jazz', a fantastic late night out - bands play from around 9.30. 50RMB cover charge",
