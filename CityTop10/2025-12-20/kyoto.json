    "detail": "As soon as we arrived we knew we were going to have a faboulous stay Recepcion hall is an open courtyard where a nice open fireplace warms you up as soon as you arrive There is also a great bar (with an other fireplace) My boyfriend is a smoker and as in Japan smoking areas are really hard to find he really enjoyed this one as it was in a great space. After our welcome drink (which was amazing!!) we got few information about the hotel and we have been really pleased discovering the Onsen was a free in house guest facility The Onsen was great we put on our super comfy kimono and enjoyed the hot water tub. Staff was great and really helpful, they even helped us book a great traditional dinner in a restaurant. We didn't really want to leave! I highly recommend this hotel in Kyoto ",

    "detail": "I loved this hotel -- the room is pretty small, but I don't even think that is worth complaining about since all hotels in Japan have small rooms. I stayed in three hotels while in Japan, and this one had the most spacious and comfortable bed out of them all. I had a king-sized bed in my room. The hotel itself is really cool -- I loved the decor and the very modern, relaxed vibe. The public onsen in the basement was really nice, especially during the winter and after a long day of walking. We paid for the breakfast which is definitely worth it. The food was great -- a mixture of traditional Japanese foods with some more typical hotel breakfast-type food. It was just really nice to wake up and be able to not worry about where to find breakfast in the morning. Location was also super ideal for a tourist. I LOVE the neighborhood ! The staff were super nice and polite -- always accomodating and helpful. If I stay in Kyoto again, I would definitely book the Kyoto Granbell Hotel! ",

    "detail": "I've booked a room for 4 with shower inside. Staff good, facilities good. I reached Kyoto early in the morning, I originally just need them to keep my luggage for me and I will come back at 3 pm for the check-in process, but the staff just checked-in for me, so I get a good place to take a rest, so thankful for the convenience that I've been given. The nearest subway station is Gojo station, take the exit 2 and you will see a orange color Yoshinoya restaurant, keep go straight as the restaurant will be your right hand side, until you see a OC cafe ( I think is the second street) you turn right to the street and keeeep go straight again until you see a convenience shop (mini shop) on you left hand side, the hostel just opposite to the mini shop.

    "name": "Sakura Terrace -Adult Only-",
    "detail": "We stayed at the Sakura Terrace Hotel in Kyoto during the busy last week of November 2013. We paid US$160 per night, without breakfast, but it should be about half that during off-peak periods. The hotel opened in October 2013. It is conveniently located one subway stop south of Kyoto station, with the Kujo station exit right in front of the hotel entrance. Alternatively, it is a six minute walk from the east exit of Kyoto station. The room is 18 sq metres, and has a decently sized attached bathroom/toilet. Comfortable bed and strong flow of hot water in the bathroom. Free wifi, fridge and hot water boiler in the room. Our room was just next to the lift, but there was no noise. Split unit aircon for cooling or heating, but, unfortunately, very limited English language TV. Free washing machine and dryer located on the 4th Floor. Bar and breakfast room on the ground floor. Pleasant English speaking staff at reception. Only smoking room was available at time of booking, but the reception staff managed to switch it to a non-smoking room. Overall, I would rate the hotel as a 4-star, even though it does not have any restaurant or room service within the hotel. (Visitors have lots of food options at the restaurants nearby the hotel or at Kyoto station.) We will definitely stay there again when we are next in Kyoto. ",
