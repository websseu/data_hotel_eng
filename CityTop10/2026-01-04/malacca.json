    "detail": "It took us a while to check in as it has a very small reception, probably as it did not have as many rooms. The guests before us had some deposit issues and the staff (trainee) was unable to handle very well. Although they had up to 2 other staff arrived to handle that issue, they completely ignored us until I insisted to be served and checked in. Rooms are truly spacious and luxuriously decorated but one of the rooms had bad smell emanating from the toilet. I wonder if it is becos hotel was converted from old shophouses. Anyhow, we are quite happy with the rooms so we didn't make an issue out of it. One of the rooms had a huge bed, bigger than a king-sized bed, comfortably sleeping 3-4 persons. Hotel was well located, most places was walking distances away n not too near crowded or noisy places. We walked everywhere to explore the heritage and historical sites. They served set breakfast and their restaurant faces the river, which was lovely to have a meal in the morning as it was very nice, charming and breezy and during the night for beer or wine. Staff are warm and friendly, just maybe not as well trained. Perhaps a professional Manager doing his rounds will help improve matters n straighten out their priorities. We love this hotel and if we ever return to Malacca, this with definitely be our choice stay. ",

There is bazar in front of the hotel. If you walk a little bit and across the bridge. There is famous eatary place of cendol kampung hulu. Places a bit crowded and looks famous among the locals. Only the breakfast is not much variety. But the tastes is good. Will stay again if coming to Malacca in future. Thumbs up!",

Staff are friendly and relaxed, accommodating for late arrival 1am and late check out, happy to hold luggage. Room has everything you want, kettle, complimentary water, comfortable bed, TV. The bathroom is modern and clean however the shower shares same room as toilet, so that can make the floor wet. This dries quick however so didn't bother me too much. Really excelling location right next to jonker walk - so it's easy to just walk out the door, explore! ",

    "detail": "It is true that this hotel has the largest room in Malacca. Room is very comfy and facilities are good. Staff is very polite. Design is quirky and charming. A thing I want to note is you can tap into the carpark with your room key so it is very convenient rather than having to go to the counter to validate the parking ticket every time. Breakfast is standard for a 4-5 star hotel, still looking for a hotel in Malacca with a breakfast that awes.",
