This reviewer has a habit of misbehaving in first-class hotels (although not for the bath tub) and he hereby apologises to all Cebu first-class hotels. The Agoda price for three persons was double the price for two persons. Agoda.com went on to find a cheaper price – for three persons - through one of its partners. The Agoda document said – to the hotel – that it – the latter – would be paid, not by Agoda but, through a third party. Upon check-in, with three persons for four nights, we were told, we had only breakfast for two. We didn’t mind. Upon check-out, the breakfasts for the third person were reimbursed.",

The service by the staff was amazing, room and housekeeping the best and food, off the charts. The best breakfast buffet ever and I'm serious, the Cafe is the best. If you want an experience like never before visit the Twighlight Rooftop Lounge. Keep up the great work Bai Hotel, I will be back again and again when I return to Cebu.

However, the Parklane remains my favourite as it gets the balance right between value for money and comfort. The hotel is friendly. The restaurant is very good. The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",

(unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",

Positive: breakfast, pool, location, clensliness. Negative: Rooms are super small, the bathroom is less than 5 sqm., u nearly cant turn around; the aircon of the room is powerless, it needs many hour to cool it down; the building feels hot, around 32°C; the price for value is better at other Seda hotels, or also at Waterfront, Radison or Quest.

The staff once again are considerate beyond belief, friendly and helpful making our experience very enjoyable. The food is great, the room service from Aaron and housekeeping from Jenny. Outstanding general attention and kindness from all levels of management and staff including a very warm and extremely hospitable Dazzle, Richard , Sabrina still a trainee but beaming with a promise. and too many persons to be able to cite by name but all of them outstanding and much appreciated. The hotel operators like Farah and Adel are both very helpful and accommodating. Another, impressive memory was during our latest visit when Rose, the business executive manager when learning that I was temporarily ill send her assistant to bring me Gatorade. The staff at the swimming pool have always been extraordinary in their attention to our needs and comfort which we appreciate. We are deeply indebted for the fine service at the pool from Charisma who is always been very kind and thoughtful in making us feel at home and comfortable. The food is excellent with new creations and innovation with their NEW OUTDOOR RESTAURANT you can really dine with the StARS and have Romantic evening with candlelight to make guests love the outdoor meals served including superior and premium steaks that my wife and I dearly loved,that WE DINE 2 nights in a ROW ! Lastly, Sous chef ,Joeffrey and executive chef Roberto Kunitz are wonderful in terms of their service to customers and are much appreciated by this customer and family. A hallmark of this beautiful restaurant is there breakfast Buffet which is the most elegant and varied breakfast buffets I’ve ever tried in my worldwide travels. The food is not only delicious but is served by the staff with loving care and attention to the guests is”exceptionnel” ",

Room service was served cold and one of the dishes was overcooked; we requested new service and were happy with the replacement dishes. We again had food served cold in the restaurant the next day which was disappointing, but the staff did their best to address our concerns. Overall, we were happy with our stay and hope the Hotel works on the concerns we shared with them so that the guest experience can be improved. ",
