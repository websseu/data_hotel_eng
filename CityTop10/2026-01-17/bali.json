    "detail": "There are a lot of really nice things about the W but there are some downsides too. The good: The interior design is very well considered and we appreciated the details. Rooms were excellent, the communal areas were breathtaking and very ... 'cool' (horrifically general word but I think this is what they're intending it to be). The pools were nice and the restaurants were pretty well designed also. The best thing was the sunset - breathtakingly beautiful! Room service was reasonably good also, once or twice they forgot something but on the whole it was above par. The bad: The concierge Whatever whenever never worked - it became a joke that whatever whenever meant that they'd do whatever they felt like whenever they could be bothered. I think this was mostly because they were so understaffed that random staff trying to help jumped in and confused everything. Next, the outdoor areas are badly designed and tiny, for a hotel this size it needs at least 2x the outdoor space to function at a 5 star level. We found ourselves always messing around trying to find available poolside space as if it were a nasty 3 star all inclusive resort. There were no private places however I think if you take a villa you get some garden area but no beachside. The cocktails are totally watered down overpriced for bali. I know that this is an international grade hotel however the drinks to standard as you'd expect globally but were priced about the similarly Lastly: there wasnt really anything balinese, which was a huge shame. Bali is such a beautiful place-attitude, culture, art & craft, it would have been nice if some aspect of this was incorporated -this hotel could have been anywhere in the world as nothing of Bali really came through. Don't be put off, if you're looking for a place which is beautifully designed, beside a beach (where you cant swim) and amongst other premium grade hipster wannabes then this is really your home. ",

    "detail": "Me and my wife totally loved our stay in this hotel. We have lived in three hotels in Bali so far and this one is our favorite in terms of 1) service ( the staff was always very helpful and nice. Always smiling and being just so nice. From the managers to security at the front door everyone was just so kind and welcoming. Yasa and Putu left a handwritten card and did all their best to leave us a great impression about this place. Also in terms of the rooms cleanliness and design tops our three hotel experiences. Rooms cage a very good sound insulation. The next door water park people’s screams could be heard only outside of our rooms. Facility-wise and would say it’s not the largest pool in Bali but nice and quite. There is almost always a live performing of the traditional very relaxing bamboo music . Water btw was just the perfect temperature. Location - I would say a good location but not perfect if you like to swim in the see you’d have walk a good 10minutes walk. But very conveniently they have a free “golf-car” to take you to the closed shopping mall that is not far away from the beach. Overall our stay was amazing. If you don’t mind a walk to the sea. You want a quite nothing to worry experience in a modern looking nice place choose this one. ",

    "detail": "Where do I even begin? This place is bomb.com I stayed here a total of 4 different times during my 2 month long travels throughout Indonesia. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, I couldn't help but go back every chance I had. The staff, two words: Beautiful Souls. Throughout my stay here, I had become friends with most of the staff. And let me tell you, they are good at playing match-maker and beer pong! Super friendly and light hearted, I love them all. Breakfast is yummy, and you get choice of fruit, pancakes (instagram worthy plating, I might add), mie goreng, english breakfast, and probably something else I'm forgetting. There's complimentary tea, juice, coffee, too! The rooms themselves are top notch. Fluffy duvets, comfy pillows, huge mattress, privacy curtains, shelving and outlet for personal use. Definitely the best hostel I've ever stayed at ever. EVER. There's a reason this place has such a high rating-- Just book it already, you're doing yourself a favor.",
