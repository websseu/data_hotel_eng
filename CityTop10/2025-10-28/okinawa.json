The hotel was immaculately clean and the room / cabin is sufficient for few nights as it is minimalist approach but still well executed. Towels, pajamas, safe for your valuables, slippers and comfortable bed even for me 1.88m tall guy. The folding doors are not really sound proof but when respecting the no talk on the phone rule and when you put your mobile to silent mode than it is o.k. Yes you will hear people walking down the corridor but this is the price to pay for this kind of accommodation but as traveler I always have ear plugs as they are number one necessity, even in some hotels. Bathrooms and shower facilities are amazing as the cleanliness and layout including the toiletries are well matching some five star hotels. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wish to stay Japanese style for relatively cheap money and experience something different. ",

    "detail": "The rooms were extremely well thought out and despite being small, felt very comfortable and cosy to stay in. The beds were excellent, and we really loved the public bath upstairs, which was a godsend after a day of walking. They have a lounge where you can get coffee and soft drinks, as well as provide umbrellas to borrow if it's raining that day. Although they have limited parking, they will immediately direct you to another parking building opposite if the hotel one is full. This is a tiny bit cheaper than the hotel parking, but is still secure. Don't worry about not having parking if you're renting a car (which you should to get around the best sites in Okinawa). Excellent service, excellent place to stay and I'm surprised it's only rated as 3 stars. With the amenities, I would have expected this to be rated 4 stars. I would not hesitate to stay at Almont Hotel again, in Okinawa or one of their other hotels around Japan.",

    "detail": "The location of this hotel is not in the middle of town, or the main drags like Kokusai dori or Makishi etc. It's sort of near the Miebashi yu rail stop. There's nothing of interest, just a normal neighbourhood. However, it doesn't really matter if you, like many travellers, are renting a car and driving around the island. Car park is right next to the hotel, and it charges a flat 1000 yen per car per day, regardless of number of coming and going. I find this standard and fairly reasonable. Lobby is on 2nd floor, and the staffs are very kind and helpful. We were most impressed by the large size of our twin room, much bigger than many other hotels of similar category. For two of us, we can spread out comfortably, have our suitcases lay out too. Beds are comfortable, very quiet at night. Very impressed also by the provision of drip coffee packs instead of instant ones. Overall, we had a very good stay, and would highly recommend it to anyone.",
