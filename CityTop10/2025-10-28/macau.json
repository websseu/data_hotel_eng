    "detail": "Studio City Hotel is the perfect choice if you are on holiday with kids, but also want to enjoy adult things that a casino can offer. Studio City is a legitimate resort, with plenty of restaurants, amenities and fun things for the whole family. For kids there is the Batman Dark Flight simulator ride which is the best 4D ride i've ever been on. There's a WB Fun Zone which is a giant kids play area, comprising of multiple floors and can keep kids entertained for hours while you are enjoying the casino. Or can spend time with the kids. The giant pools with water slides, hot jacuzzis and a lazy river cant melt away the afternoon. In the middle of the hotel is the Golden Reel, a built-in ferris wheel attraction. Lots of places to eat. with the only complaint being that room service stops at 10:30pm. The room is very nice. There are two towers, the star tower and the celebrity tower. We stayed in the celebrity tower which seemed to be the less exclusive of the two. But it was easily a 3-4 star room. Has everything, great view and spacious. The hotel can be seen from the airport and is near the Venetian. It's a $50 Macau dollar taxi ride from the hotel to the airport. Overall completely recommend Studio City Hotel for any stay in Macau. You won't have to leave the resort at all unless you want to.",

    "detail": "Sheraton Macau was a surprise to me. I am the type who reads hotel reviews first before I book. I chose the Club King with Lounge access because buffet breakfast is included (just being practical). Fortunately, it also comes with an afternoon snacks and evening cocktail which for me is a big big plus. When we entered the lounge, we were greeted and attended to immediately by one of the hotel staffs (great job Alfie Rocamora). Staff like him is an asset to the company, very efficient so our check in was fast. Everything was explained, he knows what the guests need to know. We were able to check in at 130pm and was allowed to check out 1pm the following day (i have never experienced this with other 5 star hotels in Macau...only with Sheraton). We were also upgraded to a Cotai View room (what more can you ask for?). The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was really nice. Outdoor pools are beautiful but the weather wasn't good at that time. Temperature was still cold (19degrees) so we were not really able to enjoy, we just took pictures of the surroundings. I highly recommend this for the quality of the hotel and staff performance as well as the value for money. Overall, it was an excellent stay!",

Minimum stakes: Room service was fast and good. No ridiculously high deposit required for incidentals. Just for 2 nights (and I assume it'll be the same for more nights) - there are many hotels in Macau whichT. It's fully refundable Poor shuttle service (it's like once every hour to the ferry terminal only) but you can take a cab to the ferry terminal where you can hop on to other free buses to other resorts like The Venetian, Galaxy, etc. It's walking distance to Star World, Wynn, Lisboa, etc. that are on the main Macau peninsular. Free breakfast included with many room rates including my cheap one. Very average food but it's buffet style. Better than nothing I guess. Free welcome drink too, at a bar with literally has 3 tables and zero customers but whatever. One free drink (bottled beer, juice, coffee/tea) without any minimum spend. Decent satellite channels and local (HK, Macau, and CCTV ones). If it's at around on a non-Saturday, it's worth it. Free Wi-Fi internet that doesn't seem to limit the number of devices per room.",

I would also like to thank the Assistant Manager there who patiently shared with me everything about Macau - the attractions,transportation,things to buy, and most importantly the nice food! :) We loved the free shuttle bus as well! We took the bus from Macau Ferry Terminal to right in front of the hotel. There is also free shuttle bus to City of Dreams (from there you can also walk to the Venetian Macau and the famous street, guan ye jie).

    "name": "Harbourview Hotel",
    "detail": "I didn't expect tk stay at such a beautiful hotel at this price! HK and Macau hotels are quite overpriced, but I think Harbourview hotel is not. First of all, it's really close to ferry station 5min by shuttle bus and Sands macau hotel 2min by walk where u can take the suttle bus to Venetian hotel, ferry station, and other casinos. Rooms are antic and beautifully designed. The shower booth and bath are perfect and all the soaps are Loccitant products. On the first floor, there is Goudiva shop where u can buy the wonderful chocolate icecream and drinks. I didn't have breakfast there, so can't judge it, but the rest of the service was perfect. ",

    "detail": "They upgrade our room from Deluxe into Suite, because they have full book room on thats date. Receptionsit very helpfull and tell us about how we can go to tourism destination in Macau, and they provide us with Macau maps. There is shuttle bus (cooperate with Galaxy Hotel bus) so we can go to another place for free. But shuttle to Airport start from 11 AM - 10 PM. Room is big, very clean, and so many free minibar. Thank you Broadway, if I comeback to Macau I will stay at this hotel again for sure.",
