    "detail": "The Yue Hotel is good value for money if you are coming with a family. My family of five stayed a total of three nights with three in one room and two in the other. The morning breakfast is a real plus with an excellent selection of food at the buffet. The hotel has easy access to Century Park, nearby Kerry Parkside Mall, (a little overpriced for Shanghai), The metro is directly underneath the hotel, and there is a really great cheap supermarket across the road. Ten minutes by taxi and you are at AP Plaza great for fake brand shopping. The Bund is within easy reach and the airport is about 45 minutes (130 yuan) or thr Maglev station is less than 10 minutes away by taxi or subway. There are some pretty crappy hotels in Shanghai and we made the mistake of staying at one once. The price was not far different but it was in a different league completely. One thing to note is that the wifi is available in the lobby not in the rooms. Lan cables are available in the rooms. Well worth your money, with or without the breakfast. We have no complaints. Speak slow and simply with the staff in English. It works out better. ",

There are a handful of restaurants along the river front, and of course the ubiquitos Starbucks. Some are bars, some cafes, some restaurants. Just take yourself along for a wander and explore. It is a great view of Shanghai, seeing the Bund from Pudong s the best way to see it, especially if you settle down for a bite or a drink. All the options looked dcent, tho perhaps it can be a bit quiet. The hotel is across the road road from the Super Brand shopping mall. Getting a taxi is not too bad, but if there is either a queue, or you just don't see any taxis, then walk over to the mall where there is usually a few of them waiting on the corner. If you dont fancy the standard, expensive buffet breakfast, take yourself over to the mall to Starbucks, or Lavazza or one of the local options. There is also a metro station just a few minutes walk away. ",

Despite a lot of confusion over the bookings, and a mistake on the part of the hotel, they were very accommodating and solved the problem quickly. The art deco design of the hotel is interesting and historic, and the rooms were larger than I expected given it's central location. They didn't have breakfast included in our bookings, which was disappointing, but they are extremely convenient to street breakfast, Starbucks, and other nicer places to eat (for other meals as well). Their convenient location to Line 2 made for an easy transition between Pudong airport, Hongqiao airport/train station, and Shanghai Railway station, as well as easy access to sites and nightlife on Line 1, and minimal taxi rides to other locations. It's also a comfortable and enjoyable walk to the Bund. All-in-all, I think this hotel, booked at about 100 USD per room (both twin/double were more or less the same price), was well worth the price based on it's great service, fantastic location, and comfortable accommodations.",

    "detail": "This 12-to-20th floor hotel is located in a major posh shopping district of Shanghai and there is a metro station just across the street. The amenities are limited for a five-star rated hotel, but the facilities offered are tasteful and top-notch. Our room had a spectacular view overlooking the magnificent Jing-An Temple and beyond. Shopping and food in the area is more than plentiful. The building also hosts a famous spa just below the hotel. The breakfast offering was smaller than expected but still sufficient for both local and western taste buds. The emphasis is on quality rather than quantity. The only minor complaint was the lack of a bathtub. By the way, service is always pleasant and splendid for Chinese-speakers/ nationalists. It seems that most complaints about bad service in China on Agoda are from non-Chinese speakers. Well, conversely... I almost never see any other country catering to non-English/local languages. Well, you know what they say… “When in Rome… ”",

    "detail": "I have stayed in other hotels in Shanghai previously but this hotel I would say is the best so far in terms of location, cleanliness, helpful staff, good food served at the restaurant and also strong WiFi signal in room. This hotel so near to the Bund just 8-10 minutes walk and many shopping outlets also within walking distance with the famous Nanjing Street just a stone throw away. I will definitely stay at this hotel from now onwards. For anyone still searching for a hotel in Shanghai, I recommend this hotel without reservation. ",
