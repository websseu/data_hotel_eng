    "name": "Shinjuku Granbell Hotel",
    "detail": "Arrived very late at night from Haneda International Terminal through both Monorail & JR Yamanote Line, I had to spend around 20 minutes to find the right way from JR Shinjuku Station. However, it's inside Kabuki-cho, which is one of the best place to have a night drink in Tokyo. But also, the staff is very kind as they kept my 50,000 yens CoD order while other hotels in Tokyo would refuse. For French visitors who are not fluent in English, this is the right place to find French-speaking staff. The room size is correct according to Tokyo standards and it's equipped with Shiseido amenities everywhere. I would also recommend to have a delicious breakfast on the top of the hotel to get a wonderful landscape of Tokyo.",

    "detail": "I stayed for 4 nights in the single room. The room was tiny, not much bigger than the bed with a standard Japanese bathroom (bathroom/shower + sink and toilet). This is typical for Tokyo hotel rooms, so not unexpected, just be aware that you will have very limited space. Heating/cooling worked fine, and there was hot water in the shower. WiFi also worked well, and there was a huge flat screen TV on the small desk that guests can watch from the bed. I did not use breakfast or spa facilities while there. The value was very good, but perhaps the price was so low due to the coronavirus effects. I would stay here again because of the good location and competent staff.",

What I liked of the Shibuya branch was the close proximity to subway / JR trains (if you walk through Mark City mall it may be even closer) and the many restaurants that are easily accesible from the hotel. Unlike other APA hotel branches this one didn't have a traditional Japanese hot publich bath (they usually have one at the basement or top floor), but the coin laundry was useful to me. I will choose APA again in the future.",

    "name": "APA Hotel Asakusa Tawaramachi Ekimae",
    "detail": "Stayed here for 6 nights. Good location right next to the elevator exit of Tawaramachi station, great to walk around the traditional neighborhood of Asakusa. Check-in process is a little bit weird with you having to enter your information on a touch screen. TINY room that barely allows you to put and keep your luggage on the floor all the time, with just a couple of hangers on the wall and no wardrobe. Being so tiny and with a window that does not open, the air can get a bit stuffy. Bed is comfortable, and staff cleaned the room everyday providing new toiletries and clean yukatas, that you can wear to sleep or to go to the public baths on the 14th floor (the best part of the hotel!). They are separated by gender, with a few individual seating showers to clean yourself before soaking in the big common baths (a big one indoor, a smaller one outdoor, and two individual outdoor baths), where you can socialize with other naked people. They include free breakfast in the Komeda Café downstairs, with 3 set options to choose from (best one is the toast with red beans). It's very nice and filling, but can get a little repetitive if you are staying many days. After our 6 nights stay in this hotel, we went to stay in another area of Tokyo for 3 nights, and on the last day we had to pass nearby this hotel to take the train out of Tokyo. It was early, we had some things to do around there, and we had a lot of luggage that didn't fit in the public coin lockers in Tawaramachi station, so we asked if we could leave them in the hotel for a couple of hours. They refused because we were not currently staying there, which I can kind of understand (even though we had just stayed there 6 nights!), but it would have been a nice gesture and avoid us the hassle to go to Ueno station to find bigger coin lockers.
