    "detail": "1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk, street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road! Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang. The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!). We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning. And were we glad we did. We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you! Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up",

I love the car park located on Level 2 & 3. I can access the Lobby Lift and go straight up to my room (via choice of 4 very fast Lifts). Oh yes the Dragon, constructed using recycled mineral water plastic bottle is still being displayed in the Lobby. Great for photos!",

Not only are our apartments very spacious which provides us with more than enough space to place our belongings and also walk around comfortably but our apartments were also very clean and tidy. The simple wooden design of our apartments also gave us a very relaxing vibe. Most importantly, every apartment comes with a living room, a bedroom and an ensuite bathroom which is hard to find in Penang at an affordable price. Secondly, this hotel is being situated in George Town which makes travelling to many must visit places in the vicinity so much convenient. We are all very impressed with the automated carpark system in this hotel as well (the first of its kind in Penang). Lastly, the staff members working in this hotel were all very polite and friendly during our stay there. Will definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again =D",

    "name": "Hotel Neo+ Penang by ASTON",
    "detail": "We were staying in Penang for 4 nights and booked 2 different hotels as there were some issues. We stayed in Hotel Neo Plus Penang for the first 2 nights and were very reluctant to change to the next hotel. True enough, Neo Plus was way better than our second hotel in many areas like location, room size, and cleanliness, breakfast spread and facilities. Firstly, the location is excellent and is within walking distance to many attractions like Jalan Magazine, Jalan Armenian and best of all, it is very near (less than 10 mins walk) to the best Nasi Kandar stall in Georgetown, Deen Maju! Even when you use Grab or Uber, it will take you less than RM10 to reach Fort Cornwallis (depending on demand). Secondly, we got the family room that can accommodate the 3 of us, and it was spacious. The room looks spanking new and the toilet was clean and comfortable. From our room window, we could also see Komtar, the tallest building in Penang clearly and that was quite a sight to marvel at, especially at night. Thirdly, the breakfast spread was decent but tasted great. It will sure be able to satisfy your morning hunger and keep you energized for the later walk around Georgetown. The menu also changes during the two days we stayed at the hotel. Very simple fare like rice, noodles, sausage, chicken, salad spread, bread and buns, fruits, porridge, cereals and some others. They also have an egg station where you can order any type of egg you desire. Decent, simple but filling. Lastly, the swimming pool on the top floor can be considered small but the view was stunning. Be careful of the rough edges around the pool as it is rather sharp and not fitted properly. The management can perhaps install a drinks and snacks bar on top to make the place livelier. Other small mentions include the mini mart that is located in the hotel lobby, great for buying drinks and snacks. There is also a cafe at the ground floor and we received 1 complimentary drink each. The drink wasn't great but ",

They provide services that beyond excellences. Wan provide us some local dessert while arranging our room, despite our last minute booking and late check in. Front desk colleague to the security guard at ground floor all are super friendly and they notice you right away and offer helps immediately. Housekeeping go extra miles to touch up your room cleanliness when I only requested to clear off the extra bed. This hotel is definitely a new Gem in Georgetown area. It is a hidden garden in the town and the spacious lovely room with Penang bridge view. I will definitely be back in the future with my new born baby and hope to meeting all this great people working here once again. Thank you so much for such a beautiful memories provided. Keep it up team! ",
