She also drew a map for us to the best Thai beef noodle shop near our hotel. We followed her simple map, made a few wrong turns, asked a few local stall holders and shop keepers and eventually found the famous Thai beef noodles in a corner shop opposite the BP Grand Tower hotel ! What a treat for us, it was the best beef noodles dish we had ever tasted in Thailand. We went back to eat the same beef noodles every afternoon during our time in Hat Yai. The hotel breakfasts were surprisingly good, we particularly liked the American breakfast. All in all, we had a VERY NICE stay at the Golden Crown Plaza Hotel. We will definitely stay in this hotel again in August when we travel to Hat Yai for another holiday.",

We were also able to have late check-out at 2pm upon request on our last day of stay. Both check-in and out procedures were swift and took not more than 5 mins each. The double bed room which we booked was found to be very clean and well kept, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, it is a good choice and strongly recommended.",

    "detail": "there is nothing like a good bed to sleep in after a hard days traveling. we were so happy when we go to the v.l. hatyai hotel in hat yai. it was a measly three blocks from the hat yai train station, up a road that had perfect side walks for walking people. the reception at v.l hatyai hotel was fantastic. people were happy, smiling, and most were able to speak english. the language barrier isn’t normally an important feature for us but after a very long day in minivans, ferries, buses, songteaws and on our feet it was a lovely surprise. we had booked our night in the v.l. hatyai hotel because of tripadvisor’s reviews and through agoda, who offered a very good rate for the room without breakfast. the room alone cost just under $30 usd without breakfast. when we enquired about the breakfast it would cost us 100 baht each, a whole $3 usd each. it was a fine breakfast too. bacon and eggs, yummy bread for toast, asian savoury delights, the makings for tuna salad, coffee, tea and milo, and for breakfast-dessert, bbq’d sticky banana rice in banana leaves. mmm! as we were so tired on the night of our stay we got room service. this is not ordinary for us but when we looked at the menu in our room the prices were so reasonable we didn’t feel the need to find a street food stall! how could a room service tuna salad only cost 80 baht? unheard of in a hotel. we ordered room service, pigged out on glorious food and watched english language television all night. the only downfall the v.l. hat yai had was that you had to purchase wifi / internet. the cost was reasonable, 20 baht for 24 hours of usage. if you could get it working that is. we found that the wifi worked best down in the lobby. all in all, the v.l. hat yai was a fantastic hotel. we really do recommend you consider staying there for one or two nights on your travels. break up that marathon journey between thailand and malaysia. you won’t regret it.

    "detail": "Its a shame about the cobwebs in the room which really are not out of reach from a cleaner's feather duster or broom. Apart from that, the hotel seems pretty clean. We had nice new bedside lamps in our room but all the rest of the furniture was very old and in most cases damaged. The 'deluxe' room seems to be the corner rooms (4 on each of the 6 floors) and features a wrap-around balcony. The addition of two chairs and a table would have made this balcony so much more appreciated as we had a good view of Hat Yai from up there and the weather is warm (even at 3am). The aircon was effective but made some noise which was a bit annoying when you're trying to fall asleep or watch TV. Some English channels are available. The hotel is centrally located and the staff are friendly - though not very capable of English. Free Wi-Fi is available though the signal is weak in the room. We were in (602). Neither the bathtub, nor the basin had drain plugs making bathing impossible and shaving very hard as the basing doesn't have hot water either. The shower was luke-warm at it's hottest setting and you have to try real hard to find a spot where too much water doesn't shoot right past you. The Toilet was terrible as we had to hold down the button for 1 minute or longer and watch how it slowly flushes away - and even then not everything was flushed. The little bar fridge's freezer compartment we had in our room was frosted up. Also, unlike the other hotels we've stayed at in Thailand this hotel does not offer a complimentary bottle of water so think twice before opening the 10 Baht bottle of water in the bar fridge. The thick curtains did a good job of keeping the morning sunlight out of our room though. I would not recommend this hotel, nor would I stay at it again unless my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd options are fully booked.",
