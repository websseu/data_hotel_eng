This is the best hotel in the location if you want luxury at a good value. The food here was very good also. This was our first time taking young children with us to Chiang Mai. The staff were very friendly and helpful with the children who were ages 1 and 3. We will definitely come back to the Centara. We love Chiang Mai.",

Also, there is a lot to do around Stay with Nimman as it is a more modern growing location. A must try in Chiang Mai is khao soi noodles!",

Despite of this, we will be satisfactory with swimming pool owing to cleaness and view showing the main city and road. by the way, if you guys have plan to go chiang mai and still looking for hotel. you' d better to book here now. believe me.

    "detail": "This is the 2nd time I’ve stayed here. The 1st time was 5 years ago and I loved the place. This 2nd time didn’t disappoint. Lovely room, good food and an army of friendly staff. The breakfast buffet has much variety, catering for all tastes and there are many staff on watch to top up your coffee. The Lobby tourist information desk is helpful. It is 10 minutes’ walk to the Night Markets however, they have become overpriced with limited variety of goods. However, this is the best location nearby for a wide range of mid to higher priced cafes, restaurants and bars. Without these markets (starting at 6 pm) the nearby eating, drinking and shopping options are limited. Chiang Mai is a large city where tourist attractions are spaced a long way apart. There is not really a central Chiang Mai location for a hotel. There are plenty of transport options from the Empress. The airport is some 20 minutes’ drive away, costing around 160 THB by taxi. Chiang Mai has a very broad variety of attractions and a range of organised tours are available. Such tours usually include visits to wildlife and adventure activities plus jewellery and craft stores. The craft and artistry in Chiang Mai are amazing and worth seeing but can be expensive to buy. The taxi driver from the airport gave his business card, offering pre-arranged tours or a full daytime charter costing 2000 THB where you chose where you go or not go. I chose to focus on the religious, cultural and historical attractions. Visiting only these attractions took 2 full days and the driver visited many wonderful modern and ancient places. Before, I did not know that Chiang Mai had such a rich ancient history, ruins and similar attractions. These are not that well promoted as wildlife, adventure and crafts seem to have the best publicity. Sadly the Chiang Mai Zoo, which was amazing before, has gone down badly and is obviously struggling. The big drought in Thailand is not helping matters. After the disappointment of the Chiang Mai",

The Wi-Fi worked excellent in our room and everywhere in hotel. And did I mention they have a great little pool for cooling off after a hot day hiking around town? The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The front desk helped us book a trip to Chiang Rai and everything worked out great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for the money. I'd also recommend booking your hotel with the included breakfast. The breakfast has a good selection of both western and Asian items and you could even get omelets or eggs cooked to order. Coffee, tea, juice, toast and a good selection of fresh fruits were also available. Next trip to Chiang Mai I won't need to research a place to stay, I'll be staying here.",

    "name": "Art Mai Gallery Nimman Hotel Chiang Mai",
    "detail": "The Art Mai Gallery Nimman Hotel is located a block from Nimmanhaemin Road in Chiang Mai, a short drive from the airport. The area features many restaurants and shops. The Maya Shopping Center is a short walk away. Our room at the third floor, which featured Pop Art, was compact but adequately sized and very comfortable. The bathroom was well designed and relatively large. The room was excellently soundproofed. Despite looking out at the road, we heard almost no street noise. The staff was warm and welcoming. The front desk was well organized and easily able to answer our questions. The restaurant staff did an excellent job handling the busy morning buffet breakfast. Rather than have egg dishes on the buffet, servers take orders and have them individually prepared. We enjoyed viewing the paintings in the art gallery. Our friends in Chiang Mai had no problem finding the hotel. However, it is a 15 to 20 minute ride by tuk-tuk into the center of the old town where many of the temples and museums are located. Nonetheless, we would recommend this well-run hotel to friends, especially if they wish to stay near Nimmanhaemin Road or Chiang Mai University. ",

    "detail": "A friend and I had a twin room at this lovely boutique hotel for four nights in February. The hosts are so friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The room was spacious and very clean. Vegan breakfast wasn’t a problem. In fact it was delicious. Lots of fruit, toast, cooked meal and the best sticky rice and mango. The outside seating area is very quirky and a great place to sit and eat in the morning. I would definitely recommend this as a base for your sight seeing in Chiang Mai. ",
