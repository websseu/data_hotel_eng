    "detail": "we booked 2rooms and were a group of 4gurls. we took the deluxe room facing the sea. i have been to malacca many many times for the past 20yrs, at least once a year, and this is the best best best hotel ever!!! stepping in, the decor blew me off. one of the hotel guys overheard my friends and i wondering where the lifts were to get to our rooms.. n he showed us the way without us asking. opened the lift door for us! when we reached our rooms, omg! we were amazed there were 2 flat screen tvs n even a couch! the decor is superb! modern fittings.. great bed.. lovely bathroom with choice to have a rain bath... im very picky with bathrooms.. n this is just great! water heater was hot n good! u can dim the side lamps.. they even had the option to listen to music on the tv.. great! breakfast is also great by malacca standards! the best breakfast i ever had! the guy cooks omelettes fresh for u.. reminded me of my thailand hotel stays. food is great! try their nasi lemak n curry chicken!! service is impeccable! they cleared our breakfast plates as soon as we were done with it. excellent service! the location is fantastic as well! just a 10-15min walk to jonker street, a 1 min walk to mahkhota parade shopping centre and it is also directly linked to the dataran megamall by an airconditioned bridge. overall, it was fantastic!!! had our new year countdown in my room.. tv fireworks food drinks great company... best stay in malacca in my entire 20yrs travelling there. it would be great if we could open the windows so we can really smell the sea.. n the aircon doesnt seem to set to 18deg but remained at 25degree. guess its the setting. other than that, no flaws! will definitely come back n i strongly recommend ppl to stay here!!!!

Staff are friendly and relaxed, accommodating for late arrival 1am and late check out, happy to hold luggage. Room has everything you want, kettle, complimentary water, comfortable bed, TV. The bathroom is modern and clean however the shower shares same room as toilet, so that can make the floor wet. This dries quick however so didn't bother me too much. Really excelling location right next to jonker walk - so it's easy to just walk out the door, explore! ",

Over all my stay here for one night experience, my advise for you don't book residence tower as even is new hotel but the room no well maintain and the most important the lift, oh my god this is so horrible!!! I bet 10 customer out of 9.5 are complaining the same problem of the lift! 1) we waited lift just get to our room for more then 15mit , trust me is more then 15mit, there is 6 lift on 3A(reception floor) but only 4 lift can access to residence room and the lift no air-con can you imagine from 3A to level 20th floor(the highest 42 floor) the lift are full and need to stop at almost every floor the smell of sweat in lift so disgusting !空气不流通 2) My hubby call housekeeping ask to send toothbrush set Coz there is no provide in our room and we been wait for more then 40mit . hello is 40mit ,just to get toothbrush !!!! Terrible! I do went to my parents room which in hotel tower at level 11 floor ,the room maintenance and housekeeping/room services and the most important lift much better and faster we ask for extra pillow send to room just within 10mit, same hotel same management but service so much different. 3) on the second day before check out i took shower and wash my hair after all only realize there is no hair dyer at room my hubby call again to house keeping ask for it and still waited for 20mit just to send one hair dyer, really fed up of it My advise to Swiss garden malacca management : Your staff are friendly and good smiling enough, first thing to change is the residence lift must have a solution to solve the main problem and hire more staff. I Will only be back after have improvement otherwise no way, same price we can have many option and better hotel in malacca.",

    "detail": "Hotel was newly built therefore it is definitely still pretty nice. I booked the Straits Suites and it was huge! downside was the balcony was locked and you are unable to get access, suspect they locked up due to safety issue. The place was just beside Hattan Square therefore it is quite centralised. Need to cut across a small dark alley from Hatten hotel to reach Straits. Felt quite unsafe walking through the alley. (Unless you drive around in Malacca) Carpark was easy to manoeuvre as compared to several other hotels. Friendly staffs, brighten up your stay in hotel. Did not provide most things in suite example : pots, bowls, eating utensils (So why you provide a stove to cook?) No hair dryer so beware ladies if you need 1. xD Feels more like you are at home, in a service apartment than a hotel. (Flooring is not those hotel carpet) I like. xD Thumbs up for the front desk ladies for the big smiles you gave me when checking in and out! I'm sorry I forget your name. ;( ",
