The common room also has a balcony to enjoy the view. From staying at this hotel has allowed me experience what a enjoyable customer I got to be. Not only the staffs were always happy to help to carry my luggages to my room but they also went the extra mile in taken my intoxicated friend to her room and called the next morning to check up on her. If I visit Bangkok, I will definitely will be staying again and recommend anyone else who is reading to book at this hotel! I will not forget the staffs caring and professional service and the hotel itself!",

We visited Bangkok as first-time tourists and we stayed first in Arcadia Suites Phloen Chit for 1 night but we are not satisfied with the location, so we decided to transfer here in Eastin Hotel Sathorn for 2 nights. Location is convenient because it is just right there in Surasak BTS. This is just one station away to Saphan Taksin where the Central Pier in Chao Phraya River is located. From this pier, you can take the Express Boats going to the Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Asiatique the Riverfront. This hotel is ideal if you are going to visit these spots. But if you are in Bangkok for shopping, I suggest you book hotels around Chitlom Station, near the Central World Shopping Mall and Siam Paragon. Room is spacious, clean, comfortable. The only one thing that is lacking is the toilet bidet. Our stay in Eastin is very relaxing and we appreciate the hotel comfort and ambiance a lot.",

I would say Asia Hotel is the finest hotel and value for money I have ever stayed. 5 star service. Staff are patient and willing to go the extra mile. They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

    "detail": "Great hotel and wonderful value for money.I arrived at 7 am and was given immediate check in.I booked a standard room and was impressed by room quality and size was not huge but very comfortable for two people.Bed was very comfortable and all facilities were excellent in room.I often stay at 5 star hotels in Bangkok and would not do so again when you can get a hotel like this for the price.It is excellent value and in a lovely quiet soi but close to all the action and BTS.This was first time I have booked via Agoda and will definetly book again as room and hotel descriptions were very accurate and everything worked smoothly.

    "name": "Boss Suites Nana",
    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",
