    "detail": "This is the 2nd time I’ve stayed here. The 1st time was 5 years ago and I loved the place. This 2nd time didn’t disappoint. Lovely room, good food and an army of friendly staff. The breakfast buffet has much variety, catering for all tastes and there are many staff on watch to top up your coffee. The Lobby tourist information desk is helpful. It is 10 minutes’ walk to the Night Markets however, they have become overpriced with limited variety of goods. However, this is the best location nearby for a wide range of mid to higher priced cafes, restaurants and bars. Without these markets (starting at 6 pm) the nearby eating, drinking and shopping options are limited. Chiang Mai is a large city where tourist attractions are spaced a long way apart. There is not really a central Chiang Mai location for a hotel. There are plenty of transport options from the Empress. The airport is some 20 minutes’ drive away, costing around 160 THB by taxi. Chiang Mai has a very broad variety of attractions and a range of organised tours are available. Such tours usually include visits to wildlife and adventure activities plus jewellery and craft stores. The craft and artistry in Chiang Mai are amazing and worth seeing but can be expensive to buy. The taxi driver from the airport gave his business card, offering pre-arranged tours or a full daytime charter costing 2000 THB where you chose where you go or not go. I chose to focus on the religious, cultural and historical attractions. Visiting only these attractions took 2 full days and the driver visited many wonderful modern and ancient places. Before, I did not know that Chiang Mai had such a rich ancient history, ruins and similar attractions. These are not that well promoted as wildlife, adventure and crafts seem to have the best publicity. Sadly the Chiang Mai Zoo, which was amazing before, has gone down badly and is obviously struggling. The big drought in Thailand is not helping matters. After the disappointment of the Chiang Mai",

    "detail": "1. Comparing with the other hotels in Chiang Mai, Kokotel's price is very cheap. 2. The location is far away from the Old Town (4km which is not able to walk under the hot weather). You always need to take the tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Old Town. The hotel is near the Nimman District and you are able to take a walk about 10 minutes to the Nimman District. The location of the hotel is difficult to describe, most of the drivers did not realize the exact location. It would be better to ask the Road Number in Thailand Language in order to tell the tuk-tuk / songthaew drivers. 3. Room is clean and the toilet is also clean. 4. Staff is nice and helpful. They will provide the tourist information for you such as the Saturday/ Sunday night market. 5. Providing a breadfast starting from 07:00AM to 10:00AM. Helping us to call the airport taxi service at mid-night. Although the taxi service is not provided by the hotel, the taxi driver is also polite and helping us to take the luggage.",

    "detail": "Chiang Mai can get real expensive during the high season, but this hotel is one of the rare finds when you're not looking to bunk with strangers in a hostel. Located a bit outside the city center, you can definitely find all you need for a good night sleep. The staffs are super friendly, rooms are clean, and the location is peaceful and quiet. There were a few flaws to my stay: the room phone we're wired when we arrived, the bathroom smelled a bit funky, the door lock wasn't working, and the shower was a bit broken, but the staffs handled them very swift and professionally and we were all good by the second day of the stay. It might not be as convenient to get here if you don't have a mode of personal transportation (rented car or bike), but if you do, there's plenty of roofed parking available with 24 hours security. Overall it was a pleasant experience, would come by again if I ever need another budget stay in Chiang Mai. ",

Despite of this, we will be satisfactory with swimming pool owing to cleaness and view showing the main city and road. by the way, if you guys have plan to go chiang mai and still looking for hotel. you' d better to book here now. believe me.

The Wi-Fi worked excellent in our room and everywhere in hotel. And did I mention they have a great little pool for cooling off after a hot day hiking around town? The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The front desk helped us book a trip to Chiang Rai and everything worked out great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. You will be hard pressed to find a better value for the money. I'd also recommend booking your hotel with the included breakfast. The breakfast has a good selection of both western and Asian items and you could even get omelets or eggs cooked to order. Coffee, tea, juice, toast and a good selection of fresh fruits were also available. Next trip to Chiang Mai I won't need to research a place to stay, I'll be staying here.",

    "detail": "I stayed in a dorm under the roof. The dorm has 2 AC and a washbin. Outside the dorm is the shared toilet and bathroom. The locker for the luggage are to small to put a back pack inside. It's just for your valuables. Everything was very clean. You get a blanket and a pillow but no towel. At the terrace you have a wunderful view over Chiang Mai. Nearby is the somphet market and many temples. It's no problem to find breakfast in the surrounding. ",
