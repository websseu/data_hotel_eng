I can stay here for a 4 or 5 days for the price of one night in a small Singapore Chinatown hotel or for the same price as a low end youth hostel. Then again I like eating at the street restaurants with the local people. This is not a place for the people who need to see eye candy all around them.",

The location is very near to JB Sentral Station, which is good for anyone who is going to go to Singapore from Johor Bahru. One thing that I really like is that it has bathtub in it. However, the friendliness of the staffs should be improved. The staffs do not really greet customers when they pass the lobby, and they are not very welcome in the beginning. There is no sleepers inside the room, which is should be improved. The breakfast was really cute, but it was also very simple (cereals, breads, and fruits). Overall, I will consider this hotel if I go to Johor Bahru again and recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in Johor Bahru.",

But that was totally wrong when i step in to the hotel reception. we were welcomed with a big smile the receptionist also is very friendly. Step in the room, i was amazed with the modern deco & a very clean room.. When i enter to the toilet, i feels like i was at my home's toilet.. Eventhough the hotel does not provided hotel car park, but i am very satisfied with my stay there... when we were hungry, we just have to walk in behind the hotel building & there were lots of food stalls with variety of foods to choose. Shopping?!! just walk beside the hotel building & you can shopped at City Square, Johor Bahru.. Overall, staying in Citrus Hotel, Johor Bahru giving me a different view on budget hotel & i will definitely choose this hotel if we come to JB in future... ",

Not only Belllo Hotel among many other budget hotels in close proximity, it is impressively new, clean, comfortable, great and convenient location with 7/11 next door, 24-hour food shops, shopping malls and checkpoint all within short walking distance; our 2016 CNY stay was perfected by the great team led by the Operation Manager, Mr. Kartikh Balakrishnan. Apart from the aforesaid tangible aspects, customer services and expectations are more important to excite our holiday moods and to make our stay exceptionally memorable and unforgettable! It is worth to mention that, it was terrible to call for taxi during the CNY. When Mr. Kartikh managed to secured three taxi to fetch us to our CNY eve reunion dinner, at last, the taxi driver broke his promise without informing the hotel and had phone shut off! Frankly, I would never expect a hotel manager would proactively fetching us using his own personal car to and from restaurants with multiple trips! He even firmly declined to accept our token of appreciation in lieu of the taxi fare we are supposed to pay! Caring, attentive and thoughtful customer service are what spice up our recent stay that are suffice to cover up other shortfalls if any. I would have no hesitation to return to this hotel again and would definitely recommend Belllo Hotel to all holiday-goers going to Johore Baru. Thank you, Mr. Kartikh, Ziera, Shah, Alice, Bryan, Sol, Devi, Sal, Mattias, Ioan, Ben and Awal who have served us well. Keep up the good service!",

    "detail": "Best price you can get right in the middle of Johor Bahru City Center, ease of walking distance to the CIQ if you plan to travel to Singapore while nearby shopping center allows easy access to food and retail purchasing. One thing if you travel by car to this place, you need to pay parking per day/entry (RM6) via TnG card, but the hostel offers top-up value service. Accommodation wise they have clean comfy beds and every bed has a charging station and grooming mirror. Their common area is well equipped for both heavy or light cooking and storing your food. Shared baths have shower heaters feature and hair dryer. Longer term travelers have a lot of value gained for this price. Depending on which part of the building your bedroom located, mine L2B2 is located near to a noisy bar premise, so it is a little distracting when I am trying to sleep. It would have been solved with a sound-proof window. Staff are very friendly in guiding me around the place to familiarize with the area. ",
