    "detail": "From Sept 15th to 17th, I stayed in this wonderful Hotel together with my wife and 4 colleagues (we were on a company trip). This is my 3rd trip to Hong Kong and I must say although I paid much more for the previous 2 hotels in Hong Kong Island, but this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in Hong Kong or anywhere else! From the airport, we chose to take Bus no. A31 to take us to the hotel. The bus journey took about 55 minutes and we arrived at the hotel at about almost 8.00 p.m. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a very pleasant and friendly receptionist at the hotel who had so kindly agreed to upgrade my 3 original Standard rooms at Tower 1 into one room at Harbour View - Tower 2 (on the 85th floor!) and another Family suite room at the 82nd Floor for my 4 other colleagues! The view at both our hotel rooms were phenomenal! And I really loved my Harbour View room as the design was modern and nice and the King size bed was very comfortable. However, special mention needs to be given to the Family Suite Room here - it is Really Spacious and beautiful. There were 2 Queen size beds plus 2 single beds in the suite and it has everything- a fridge, 2 round tables, kitchen cabinets etc! I really think the hotel has been extremely generous to exchange this suite room with my original 2 standard rooms at tower 1! Meals were not a problem at all as there are very nice dim sum and chinese restaurants in and nearby the hotel. The Tsuen Wan West MTR station was also very nearby the hotel (about 15 minutes walk away) and during my 2 night stay there at the hotel, I did discover that the prices of food and other stuffs at Tsuen Wan were really much cheaper than that at Hong Kong Island. If ever I were to go to Hong Kong again, I will definitely return to stay at L'Hotel Nina et Convention Centre!",

You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

    "name": "The Mira Hong Kong",
    "detail": "Hong Kong is a mere 1 hour and 40 minutes flight away from Manila so it is a frequent destination for me and my family. We visit this vibrant city at least once a year and love going the week after Christmas. My first time to Hong Kong was when I was a 7 year-old kid and this was known back then as the Miramar. In recent years we used to stay in another hotel in Kowloon, but for the past 5 years we have been making The Mira more of our family choice the past 5 years. Every year we come back there is always something new added. It is super clean, modern and ultra chic, the bathrooms with glass walls, wi-fi everywhere...Beds are very comfortable. This is very important because in Hong Kong you have to walk a lot. (Choosing your hotel based on it being just to sleep for the night does not really apply to Hong Kong) I like the convenience of having a cell phone in each room, which allows the guest to make room to room calls; communicate with each other for free (perfect for families) while going around the city, and is an easy way to for people to contact you...certainly very convenient as we usually go our separate ways with my teenage daughters around; a money saver tool ; no need to depend on your mobile phone on international roaming! The Mira is across Knustford Terrace on Kimberley Road which has a Ben & Jerry's Ice cream on the ground floor, and an array of restaurants, and cozy bars, steak houses, restos serving Spanish tapas, Italian food,Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese restos; it's a great alternative for those who find the area of Lan Kwai Fong in Central too far , should you want a little night life. This place gets packed , yet this is what adds to Knutsford Terrace's charm. It is not in a typical building, and most of the bars /restos give the clients a choice of either staying in an open air area or inside. Really charming and picturesque at night!!",

Although it is quite far from shopping and attractions, it is very accessible by MTR (Ngau Tau Kok Station) therefore, location is not an issue. Forte restaurant is by far one of my best dining experiences in Hong Kong at affordable prices. Overall the hotel is really very good value for money. The rooftop pool is also beautiful, offering good view of the city. They also offer free mini-bar refreshments and a free shuttle bus to Kowloon Airport Express Station.",
