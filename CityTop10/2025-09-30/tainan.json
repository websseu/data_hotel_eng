    "detail": "We chose the Tai Dao hotel both for its location, just opposite the Tainan train station, and its very reasonable price! We were travelling from Chiayi to Tainan by train, then onwards to Kaohsiung also by train, so the location was ideal. Exiting the train station, you are confronted with a very large and very busy roundabout - this serves in part as Tainan’s bus terminal. Looking across the road you’ll see the building in which the Tai Dao hotel is located, on the right side of the roundabout when facing it from the train station. There are two underpasses from the train station, those with heavy luggage should take the one on the left side of the roundabout as this one has lifts, up and down - then cross two intersections (controlled by lights) to get to the tall curved building that houses the Tai Dao hotel (plus a couple of food outlets, a 7Eleven, another hotel, and more). The Tai Dao hotel reception is on the ground floor to the right side of the building when facing the building. The underpass on the right side of the roundabout will bring you out closer to the hotel, but the steps are quite steep! With its location, you have easy access to trains and buses in Tainan, plus plenty of taxis readily available. The bus that takes you to the Flower Night Market (Tainan’s largest) stops right outside the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants in the streets around the hotel, and you can walk to many of the sights for which Tainan is renowned (we walked to the Confucius Temple, to the Chihkan Tower, and more). Check in was quick and easy. We were advised that each day we would need to present at reception to collect our breakfast vouchers for the following day. Breakfast vouchers included two coffee/tea vouchers plus two TWD60 coupons for use at the 7Eleven. We found the TWD60 was more than enough for a decent breakfast to start the day. We could get up to four sandwiches, or two hot meals (pre-packaged, heated up when purchased), or a number of buns/cakes - we certainly didn’t go hungry. The included coffee was the equivalent of a large coffee by Perth (Australia) standards. To get to the rooms you can either take the lift in the hotel’s lobby to the third floor, then switch to the building’s main lifts (unless of course you’re staying on the 3rd floor, we were on level 12 or 13), or walk around the front of the building, enter the building’s main lobby, and take the building’s own lifts directly to your floor. Our room was quite spacious, with two firm twin beds. There was a bench seat by the window that served as both a handy place to pop our cases, or a spot to city watch from on high. The room included efficient airconditioning, a mini fridge, and TV. The walls of the rooms are curved, which takes a little getting used, in that your beds are neatly pushed against the wall, but are not straight. The room was very clean, even when we moved one of the beds to get some distance (yes, we both snore), the floor under the beds was as clean as the rest of the floor! As an aside, with so very many rooms, we found that unless you specifically made note to reception that you wanted your room cleaned / made up, it didn’t happen every day. We passed the cleaning ladies in the corridors daily, while they didn’t speak a bit of English, they were very friendly and smiley (one even wanted a selfie with us)! On one day that our room wasn’t made up, we requested new towels, a bit difficult with no shared language, but we got there in the end and they were more than happy to oblige. If travelling with kids, do watch out for channels 14-17 as these are adult channels (we are a mother and daughter travelling together, it was an uncomfortable moment as I was flicking through channels, very quickly realising when channel 14 came on that this was not something I should be watching with my Mum, and even worse when I quickly changed channel and found the same genre on the next three channels - much relief was felt once I got back to “regul",

UIJ only just started this March but is already very well run. The room was beautifully decorated. We have a record player in our room and countless vinyl records to choose from at the reception. Still and sparkling water plus free re-fill! I thought it was a nice touch. All the toiletries were of the highest quality. Breakfast was standard, but I thought it was quite nice to have local food as an option. The greatest part of this hotel has to be its staff! All of them were being extremely friendly and helpful. The service was greater than many 5 star hotels! Very well done! An extremely impressive hotel. Will definitely stay there again next year when we do our annual visit to Tainan! ",

The only qualm is that room service is only up to 10pm, and though the food is very good (beef noodles..yum!), the selection is very limited. Would be good to extend or have have some simple late night room service menu, and a wider selection will be nice. Overall, I think it is a very professional hotel!",

People outside if they peak, they could actually see you using toilets which is a big No for me. Besides, there’s no business center and I need to send document to the hotel so they can print it out for me downstairs at the lobby where everyone looks at you talking about printing documents. That’s another No for me. Overall I don’t think I’ll come back again since there are many other good choices of hotels in Tainan. But it’s good value for the room rate for sure. ",

For example, the breakfast. \bＩtravelled alone. And they insisted giving me two breakfasts. One eating in and another going out. As for the room, Ｉhave to say the design was just perfect. And the BED, it was five stars! Wonderful! I definitely will come back when I visit Tainan.",

    "detail": "Tainan Hotel is a four star hotel.In many aspects it's living up to those expectations. The reception staff are working very good. Always trying to help you. Some of them though don't speak English, but that's really not a problem since there are always someone else to help you. The breakfast buffet has a standard variety of Asian and Western dishes. Unfortunately they didn't succeed in keeping the food warm. So, if you like room-temperature hot dishes it is ok. The croisssants they kept in a warm box to keep them warm and fresh. The problem is that the bread was in there too long time so it was so dry, some days uneatable! The restaurant served a buffet dinner, which we didn't try, but seemed very popular among the locals. The restaurant was full every night which is a good sign. The room was good. Spacey with a desk and a small table with an armchair. Funny enough there was no safe in the room! So you have to keep your valuables at the frontoffice. And you didn't go there everyday with your laptop and your iPad. But, if you have to use your computer and wifi: forget this hotel They claim that they have wifi but 98 % of the time it just didn't work! We were lucky to get into another persons wifi (an open one!) in some evenings. I can't understand why a hotel in the year of 2013 can't have a working wifi! And this is a hotel that caters to business travelers! Our room was even called business room! The location of the hotel was great. That is their rescue. Two blocks away from the train station. The citybuses (with the touristic lines 88 and 99) just outside the hotel.",
