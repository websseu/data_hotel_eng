    "detail": "The hotel building looks old from the outside but the rooms seems to have been renovated not that long ago and seems new. For the price, I think you will be mostly satisfied with this hotel even though of course there will be better hotels in Shanghai at a higher price. The staff are polite and efficient even though communications in English may be difficult for them but that is a problem you will encounter in many places in Shanghai.",

    "detail": "Our trip to Shanghai started badly. We arrived at 01:45am at Pudong Airport and there's no Airport Pickup service, so somehow we made it to the City and tried to find a Taxi driver who would take us to the hotel, which was difficult because some of 'em didn't even know the address (we showed them the Agoda generated Taxi directions in Chinese language). In the end we arrived at the hotel at 3:45am (!) and we got our room without a problem in the middle of the night - glad it worked out! Our room was awesome, felt really luxurious and we had everything we needed. It takes you 10 minutes to the closest Metro station (two more stations from different line in 15 minutes). Breakfast was great for a tattered European stomach but a little expensive. Only negative is the surrounding provides nothing, there's no convenience store or anything close (thus it's very quiet on the other hand side) and the neighborhood doesn't look too good but that's all. We would def. stay again here!",

However, we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay at this Hilton. - great location /walking distance near some prestigious department centres: Kerry Ann, Reel which are all linked together from basement. A good omen for the hot summer in July. We like the Ole supermarket and also the One in the basement of City Plaza ( opposite to Jing An temple). Good places to buy Chinese and import grocery. - hotel: clean standard room. Friendly/helpful staff/prompt service from Ms Rachel/IT support 24 hrs service/Laura from Housekeeping/Albert from the concierge whichis fully attended for any queries. - room service: exhausted from the heat and walking all over in Xintiandi and Tanzifang, we decided on room service and totally enjoyed the xiu long bao and Hainan chicken as well as the Chinese breakfast which is quite generous for one person to finish.

    "detail": "I booked the hotel for my family and friends on their way to my wedding in China. Despite a lot of confusion over the bookings, and a mistake on the part of the hotel, they were very accommodating and solved the problem quickly. The art deco design of the hotel is interesting and historic, and the rooms were larger than I expected given it's central location. They didn't have breakfast included in our bookings, which was disappointing, but they are extremely convenient to street breakfast, Starbucks, and other nicer places to eat (for other meals as well). Their convenient location to Line 2 made for an easy transition between Pudong airport, Hongqiao airport/train station, and Shanghai Railway station, as well as easy access to sites and nightlife on Line 1, and minimal taxi rides to other locations. It's also a comfortable and enjoyable walk to the Bund. All-in-all, I think this hotel, booked at about 100 USD per room (both twin/double were more or less the same price), was well worth the price based on it's great service, fantastic location, and comfortable accommodations.",
