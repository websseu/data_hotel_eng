Besides, the staff allocated us connecting room which was ideal for us so that we do not have to leave the one room to go to another. There are some nice restaurants in and around the hotel, but the price would be on higher range. Overall, it is worth the money for a 4-star hotel!",

Shopping is just downstairs. Breakfast was good with many variety on offer & helpful staff. Guests can rest at the lounge while waiting for check-in (brilliant idea - wish more hotels can do this!) Only grouse was the parking. I checked in on a Sunday & the mall parking was full so had to drive up to the higher levels. Small thing & did not in anyway affect my stay here.

It is just a short walk from the Johor Bahru checkpoint and across the road from two popular shopping malls — City Square and Komtar JBCC. In terms of customer service, we had a pleasant check-in experience and received a free upgrade to a junior suite (we had originally booked an executive club king room). The room was spacious, comfortable and clean, nothing to complain about at all. The pillow menu we found at our bedside table was a nice welcome touch as well although we did not utilise it. Breakfast buffet selection was also quite varied and we enjoyed it very much. We did not manage to try the rest of the dining options at Amari given our short stay. While Amari's rates are certainly more expensive than the average hotel in Johor Bahru, I'd say it's worth the splurge especially if you're looking for a nice place for a quick getaway.",

Step in the room, i was amazed with the modern deco & a very clean room.. When i enter to the toilet, i feels like i was at my home's toilet.. Eventhough the hotel does not provided hotel car park, but i am very satisfied with my stay there... when we were hungry, we just have to walk in behind the hotel building & there were lots of food stalls with variety of foods to choose. Shopping?!! just walk beside the hotel building & you can shopped at City Square, Johor Bahru.. Overall, staying in Citrus Hotel, Johor Bahru giving me a different view on budget hotel & i will definitely choose this hotel if we come to JB in future... ",

    "detail": "The staffs were very helpful and friendly. The rooms and corridor has been newly renovated. The rooms are spacious, bed are comfy, room facilities are well arranged, toiletries are sufficient. This hotel deserves more than a three stars rating. Location is extremely good. The hotel are surrounded by most of the favourite/popular shopping centres and hawkers in Johor Bahru. Such as the tebrau hawker and KSL shopping mall just behind, pelangi just up a little, and a night hawker selling really delicious local food just across the road. All these places are within walking distance. Breakfast spread are considered good and atas (for the price you paying) with Egg station. I greatly recommend this hotel to everyone. Looking forward to my next visit. CONS: Shower heater abit slow in heating up the water. I have to let the water run for 15 minutes before I could step in. TV channels abit bland with local channels. Can be improved by adding some Movie Channels like Fox or HBO or Thrill. ",

    "detail": "If you want a hotel that is close to Legoland, then this is an ideal choice. We stayed over the weekend with 2 young kids and drove to Legoland on Saturday morning, and reached within 15 minutes. There was very little traffic. Hotel Granada is also situated right in front of Aeon Mall so it's easy to find food while staying here. There's a McDonalds right next door too, so easy when you need to grab a quick meal. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Breakfast spread was modest. All in all, a value for money hotel if you want a quick stay in Johor Bahru.",
