    "detail": "Butterfly on Prat was amazing. It was easy to get to, close to a lot of stores, restaurants, and places to see, and the staff was superb - friendly and efficient! We were a family of 5 (with 3 adult children), and the 2 rooms we got was kinda small for the us kids. Too bad all the twin bed rooms were fully booked, that would've been better. But that one little discomfort aside, we had a nice stay here. The internet connection was free and fast! I could not have asked for a better option. They also provide free printing services, for those of you who need your boarding passes printed after an online check-in for your flight. How to get there (the fastest way): - Take the Airport Express, and get down at Kowloon Station. - Take the free Airport Shuttle, and get down at Park Hotel (2nd stop). Butterfly on Prat will be on Prat Ave., just a block away and a short walk from Park Hotel. How to get back to the airport the fastest way: - Go back to the bus stop in front of Park Hotel on Cameron Rd., and wait for the Airport Shuttle bus - Get off at Kowloon Station - Take the Airport Express back to the airport Places to see around Butterfly on Prat: - Wah Kee Snacks (corner of Prat Ave. and Hart Ave.): delicious street food! Try the lobster & chicken balls with curry sauce. - 7 Eleven and Circle K are near - Hanjyuku Kobo (Cameron Rd. near Tsim Sha Tsui MTR B2 exit): BEST. CHEESE TARTS. EVER. - Cotton On/Typo, Nike, Lush stores on Granville Rd Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station is of walking distance from Butterfly, and you get to see different stores too on the way. From there, lots of places are accessible by train. Do check out the Apliu Street Flea Market (get off at Sham Shui Po station) for gadgets & electrical things; Fa Yuen Sneaker Street (get off at Mongkok station) for LOTS of sneakers. There are lots of museums too, near at Butterfly on Prat: Hong Kong Museum of History, Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong Space Museum, and Hong Kong Museum of Art (which was u",

    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

It has al the mod-cons in the room including a massive LED TV with a welcoming message for you and even speakers in the bathroom. Going to this hotel also really helped as I arrived at about 1am in Hong Kong and so didn't need to look for taxis or late-night transport and then hassle with check-ins in Hong Kong City. Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

In our opinion, the best part about the hotel was the large and beautiful swimming pool. There is a shallow kid's pool which was excellent for the children to play in.",

Shampoo, conditioner and soap are provided with good quality. On that day, we could delay our check out time upon our request. Overall a wonderful experience. ( But if you are looking for a hotel in city hub, it may not be suitable for you as it is inside Tuen Mun, Hong Kong)",

    "detail": "The Burlington was a pleasant surprise! Most hotels in Hong Kong are expensive and relatively small, and this was small, but it was great quality at a great price. It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",
