    "detail": "It is my 6th time to be in South Korea but my first time to stay at Hotel Peyto Gingham. The experience is awesome, 10/10 I would say for the price given. I checked in the hotel at 12:30AM at midnight and the location of the hotel was easy to find even when it was all dark outside. The hotel staff was being very helpful and kind as they reminded me that the Zen Double room I booked do not provide real high beds. So they offered to let me have a look at both the Zen Double and Deluxe Double rooms first before choosing which one to stay at since my stay was for 7 nights. Both rooms are fine and look comfortable but I eventually chose the one closer to the elevator. The hotel is located at the main street: Gangnam-daero and is just 3 minutes away from Yangjae Station (Line 3, exit 2). Although it is in Gangnam, with line 3 it only takes one to get to the touristic or shopping areas in Gangbuk within 35 minutes (i.e. Eujilro station; Myeongdong; Jongno... etc). Everything inside the room was great and the room looked really like a compact yet comfortable studio flat, at the centre of Gangnam (Seocho-gu). I stayed in various hotels in Seoul before (Lotte Hotel in Euljiro; Skypark Central in Myeongdong; Classic 500 in Konkuk Uni and etc), but I'd rank Hotel Peyto Gangnam as my first priority given its excellent location, clean and modern room, helpful front desk staff members and the not-too touristic feel that area gives.

It is right in front of Itaewon station, very convenient in city center, good access from airport and easy to move around. The room is clean and has free and fast Wifi. They used to have Korean Sauna at B1F but now the size is smaller, I still enjoy it though. Their staff is there 24/7 and helpful, they speak English and Japanese too. Money exchange is also available at the reception. One comment I should make is the noise from the neighbors, since Itaewon is a night town in Seoul, there are many people at clubs, pubs, etc. around this hotel and it could be loud (even in the hotel room) especially Friday and Saturday night. Single travelers or young couple should be fine but it might be not suitable for the family with young children. Also in summer they have small swimming pool at 5F and many, many people from outside of the hotel visit, so the elevator could be crowded sometimes.",

    "name": "Dormy Inn SEOUL Gangnam",
    "detail": "We split our stay in Seoul into 2 locations: Myeongdong and Gangnam. I picked Dormy Inn Seoul Gangnam because of the free breakfast, free ramen, self-serve laundry facilities and convenient locations to where we would be visiting during our stay in Gangnam. We were really satisfied with the widespread breakfast. Food was delicious and plentiful with changes in variety. We found that by eating a big breakfast and the free ramen, we were able to save money on meals by buying one large meal a day at lunch plus snacks of course. Who can resist Korean street food and snacks! We did not try the onsen but we saw people using it when doing our laundry. Love the self-serve laundry! We had a 23-day trip visiting South Korea and Hong Kong. Packing less clothing and doing laundry during the trip saved luggage for souvenirs. Washing is free and a small fee of 2000 won for drying. The machine has specific settings for delicate clothing items. Despite small room size, we highly recommend this hotel!",
