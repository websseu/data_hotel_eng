But it's clean (to me) and it has a private bath and shower. I can stay here for a 4 or 5 days for the price of one night in a small Singapore Chinatown hotel or for the same price as a low end youth hostel. Then again I like eating at the street restaurants with the local people. This is not a place for the people who need to see eye candy all around them.",

    "detail": "This was my first time staying at this hotel in Johore Baru with 9 other family members from 6 ~ 10 February 2016, and it was a wonderful experience! Not only Belllo Hotel among many other budget hotels in close proximity, it is impressively new, clean, comfortable, great and convenient location with 7/11 next door, 24-hour food shops, shopping malls and checkpoint all within short walking distance; our 2016 CNY stay was perfected by the great team led by the Operation Manager, Mr. Kartikh Balakrishnan. Apart from the aforesaid tangible aspects, customer services and expectations are more important to excite our holiday moods and to make our stay exceptionally memorable and unforgettable! It is worth to mention that, it was terrible to call for taxi during the CNY. When Mr. Kartikh managed to secured three taxi to fetch us to our CNY eve reunion dinner, at last, the taxi driver broke his promise without informing the hotel and had phone shut off! Frankly, I would never expect a hotel manager would proactively fetching us using his own personal car to and from restaurants with multiple trips! He even firmly declined to accept our token of appreciation in lieu of the taxi fare we are supposed to pay! Caring, attentive and thoughtful customer service are what spice up our recent stay that are suffice to cover up other shortfalls if any. I would have no hesitation to return to this hotel again and would definitely recommend Belllo Hotel to all holiday-goers going to Johore Baru. Thank you, Mr. Kartikh, Ziera, Shah, Alice, Bryan, Sol, Devi, Sal, Mattias, Ioan, Ben and Awal who have served us well. Keep up the good service!",

    "detail": "Stayed for a night in their one bedroom, it was beyond my expectation and far best stay so far in Johor Bahru. Apartment is newly opened. The parking was quite safe and I can assure that - especially for Singaporeans who have second thoughts on parking their motorbikes in Johor Bahru. The security guards were very attentive, seen them doing round checks in the premises. The check in was swift and the rooms are really clean and comfortable. Check in time was at 3pm but we checked in way earlier around 2pm. Was issued a room key however it was not really ready when we were outside our room. Waited for 10 minutes to be in the room but it is fine for me. Location is good for solo travellers too as the hotel was just a walking distance to Komtar JBCC and City Square. There’s 7-11 convenient store just right at the hotel lobby in case you need to get something urgently. Now, the cons about the apartment was the parking you have to pay on your own. (It comes with a price I guess) And the major turn off - their housekeeper was very rude. Knocked the door several times at 10:45AM to tell us to check out when we clearly knew the check out time was 12PM. Leave that alone, the housekeeper repeatedly knocked the door again at 12PM SHARP. How intense was that. I dont remember requesting the front desk to get someone for my wake up call. She was also rude when we asked the other housekeeper to confirm the check out time. She gave us her unpleasant death stare and walked away when the other housekeeper was apologizing on her behalf. Very rude and unprofessional. I hope the management can look into this matter. Other than that, theres nothing much to point out. Will still give the 5 star rating! ",

It is just a short walk from the Johor Bahru checkpoint and across the road from two popular shopping malls — City Square and Komtar JBCC. In terms of customer service, we had a pleasant check-in experience and received a free upgrade to a junior suite (we had originally booked an executive club king room). The room was spacious, comfortable and clean, nothing to complain about at all. The pillow menu we found at our bedside table was a nice welcome touch as well although we did not utilise it. Breakfast buffet selection was also quite varied and we enjoyed it very much. We did not manage to try the rest of the dining options at Amari given our short stay. While Amari's rates are certainly more expensive than the average hotel in Johor Bahru, I'd say it's worth the splurge especially if you're looking for a nice place for a quick getaway.",

Besides, the staff allocated us connecting room which was ideal for us so that we do not have to leave the one room to go to another. There are some nice restaurants in and around the hotel, but the price would be on higher range. Overall, it is worth the money for a 4-star hotel!",

However thanks to Agoda & KSL, I managed to resolve the problem & the staff who attended to me (tall Malay girl) was very patient & helpful. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Shopping is just downstairs. Breakfast was good with many variety on offer & helpful staff. Guests can rest at the lounge while waiting for check-in (brilliant idea - wish more hotels can do this!) Only grouse was the parking. I checked in on a Sunday & the mall parking was full so had to drive up to the higher levels. Small thing & did not in anyway affect my stay here. I highly recommend KSL Resort to anyone wanting a good hotel in Johor Bahru.",
