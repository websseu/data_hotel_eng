However, it's inside Kabuki-cho, which is one of the best place to have a night drink in Tokyo. But also, the staff is very kind as they kept my 50,000 yens CoD order while other hotels in Tokyo would refuse. For French visitors who are not fluent in English, this is the right place to find French-speaking staff. The room size is correct according to Tokyo standards and it's equipped with Shiseido amenities everywhere. I would also recommend to have a delicious breakfast on the top of the hotel to get a wonderful landscape of Tokyo.",

    "detail": "Everyone should try the capsule hotel experience at least one night when visiting Japan. So did I and picked this hotel based on the reviews on Agoda and couldn't be happier! The hotel is located in a 8 story building in Kabukicho, Shinjuku and it's very easy to get there. The reception is in floor 3, a common area for men & women with kitchen, restaurants, vending machines and internet café is located in floor 4. Floor 5 is used for day use capsules while the night capsules for men are located in floors 6 & 7. Women can stay in floor 8, separated from men. Staff was super nice and welcoming (contrary to some opinions here), they tried to help me from the very beginning and the people I talked to spoke fairly good English. Although customers are assigned a small locker with enough space to leave the clothes in a changing room, bigger luggage can be stored on some shelves present in both the changing room and in front of the reception. Don't be scared of leaving your items there, this is Japan and everybody respects your belongings. The place is clean and the capsule is much bigger than pictured!! Inside there is a control panel for the light, alarm, air conditioner and television, a power socket and a mirror along with the pillow and a duvet. All capsules have a curtain than can be opened/closed for privacy and but beware that some noises can come inside if other guests speak loudly (usually don't). The hotel also has a traditional Japanese bath (onsen) and sauna. Don't forget to try it before you leave! Checkout time is at 10 am and luggage cannot be stored after checking out. I had a great experience at Shinjuku Kuyakusho-mae Capsule Hotel and will definitely come back in my next trip to Tokyo.",

    "detail": "I travel to Tokyo every few months for business. This is the perfect hotel for that. Location is central, close to Ginza, Akihara, Tokyo station and only 15min to Shinjuku, 25 min to Shibuya. One step away from the metro station exit. Direct train from Haneda or Narita. Room is small but enough space (so do the other hotels in Tokyo), clean and modern. Bed and comforter is very comfy during the cold nights. Pillows are not like the western type that I know of (fluffy and kinna thick), they r very thin. But I get used to them. They provide enough amenities that you don't have to bring anything from home. Toothbrush, comb, body sponge, hairband are provided. Hairdryer, electric kettle with coffee and tea. They have the Japanese robe, yukata that I can use to sleep. So I don't normally bring pj. ",

    "name": "Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda / Tokyo",
    "detail": "We have stayed in many hotels in Tokyo and this Gotanda hotel proved to be excellent value for money with very easy access to Gotanda JR station and the Toei Asakusa subway line being only a few minutes walk. You can easily access all the main areas in Tokyo including the Tokyo, Ginza, Shibuya and Shinjuku areas in less than 20 minutes. The rooms were essentially new so are in excellent condition. We chose a twin room to have a bit more space. Our sons comfort double room was also very good but not much space to move around in. One negative was not having enough storage/ drawers for clothes or to stash a suitcase. If you prefer a soft bed you might find the bed a bit firm and it did cause a few aches for us over 8 nights but it is not as bad as some of the unbearablely, rock hard beds we have experienced in Japan.. My husband, being Japanese, loved the rooftop bath and both the men and. Women’s baths seemed to be very popular. Being able to wash/ dry clothes also a bonus.",
