The Agoda document said – to the hotel – that it – the latter – would be paid, not by Agoda but, through a third party. Upon check-in, with three persons for four nights, we were told, we had only breakfast for two. We didn’t mind. Upon check-out, the breakfasts for the third person were reimbursed.",

The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",

(unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",

    "name": "St. Mark Hotel",
    "detail": "My wife and I have been going to St. Mark's for the past few years when we are back in the Philippines for vacation. We typically spend at least a week or longer. The hotel is pristine. The rooms are always clean and modern and well maintained. The hotel truly has a look and feel of a 4 or 5 star hotel. The best part is the staff. Truly always warm, inviting, and always ready to help. The breakfast is awesome and includes American style bacon and native Cebu sausages, pancakes, eggs and other assorted foods, which make for a totally satisfying and complete breakfast. The room has a nice flat screen with great channel selections, strong wifi, hot shower, cold fridge, and cold aircon. But.........the best part......the BED. It has high thread count cotton duvet, sheets, and amazing pillows with an amazing memory foam mattress. We never wanted to leave the bed...in fact we missed a few appointments because of it, lol. The location is within a short walk to mango avenue and is right across the street from Redemptorist Catholic Church, which was nice. We attended Mass there, which makes it very convenient. Taxis can easily be hailed by the doorman, just be kind and leave a small tip. This hotel probably should sell for 80-120 a night easily, but I am glad they keep their prices in check and still offer an amazing bargain. We will continue to come back in future years and hope to always have the same awe inspiring service and ambiance we have come to know and love. ",
