    "detail": "My family and I stayed at hotel boss for 4 days in a family room with balcony (good for 4 pax).Over all the hotel room is brand new since the hotel just started last year. Everything are still crisp. Staff are all nice, helpfull, accomodating and smiling. The location is great, there are 2 MRT stations near it (Bugis Statiob and Lavender Station) which is about 5 minutes away through walking and a bus stop just right outside the hotel door. Mustafa center and bugis shopping mall is near. There are also tourist attractions near the area like Haji Lane wall art and Mosques. There is a 24/7 fast food chain (food clique) within the hotel premises which I find convenient because you don't have to worry getting hungry after a long day walking around singapore. A money changer, convenient store, restaurants, winery, and souvenir shops are also in the premises. I just hope they would maintain its cleanliness and beauty. Our room is small though for a family of 4. Our big suitcases can't just be open all the time because it'll obstruct our walk way and there is no closet. And also you have to request for a Do not Disturb sign, sometimes they're running out of it. Room lighting is nice and the wall art at the bed frame is beautiful. The balcony is big and spacious. Bathroom is nice, and clean with amenities; no bidet spray though. Shower temperature is good. Room is complete with compact fridge, tv, safety box, water boiler, and compimentary coffee & tea. The bed is good, didn't feel any back pain and good fluffly soft pillows. Nice hotel amenities with their pool overlooking Singapore Flyer and the tip of Marina Bay Sands. Generally the Hotel is at great great location, brand new, best value for money, and comfortable place to stay. I would choose to stay at this hotel again once I'm back in singapore. I would rate this hotel 9/10 üëèüëèüëèüëç. My family had a great time and payment is hassle free thanks to agoda ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç. Satisfied guest here! Great Job Hotel Boss! ",

There is a great happy hour at the bar a well-maintained pool and gym and the hotel restaurant manages to serve a huge buffet breakfast right through until 11.30am at weekends. The wi-Fi is super-fast and was included in our room rate. We were also upgraded to the premier wing which was nice although the standard wing is perfectly OK too. The only niggle is the car park. Its entrance design is very poor and awkward to reach the ticket machine at the entrance barrier as its on a sharp curve. But parking is free for guests so its only a minor niggle. Check-in and check-out is very efficient but beware the in-room capsule coffee machine. You will be charged for every capsule. ",

    "detail": "I landed in Singapore with the first flight and got into the hotel as early as 10 AM and they let me checked in to my room, while other hotels in Singapore usually only allow me to get into my room at 2 PM. This helped me a lot to have a rest in the room a bit and refreshed myself before my meetings. The room is quite big and I can enjoy free mini bar in the room replenished daily with soft drinks, juices and mineral water. All free of charge! Very generous of them! All the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Bell Service and Concierge staffs are very helpful and work very fast on baggage handling and taxi queue. They responded immediately when I had problem logging in to the wifi connection in the room, I was planning couple of weeks before my arrival to have dinner at their Carousel Restaurant and I made reservation for the dinner online on the Carousel website. They always have waiting list for Carousel and all the food was SUPERB, fresh, and has very extensive choices, especially the seafood which I loved very much!! No wonder as Carousel Restaurant is voted as the Best Buffet Restaurant in Singapore by AsiaOne People's Choice Awards for 6 consecutive years !!! Amazing. I stayed there for 3 nights and had a last flight on my check out day. It has the best location right on the city center of Singapore and within walking distance to all the shops, restaurants and shopping malls in Orchard Road area. They let me use the Business Center for free after I checked out and enjoy free drinks there for couple of hours while waiting for my night flight. Thank you Royal Plaza on Scotts ! I will definitely come back and stay there again next time.",

    "detail": "First stay at Dorsett Singapore but I have been to the lobby to pick up guests before. The staff service was impeccable as before. Service was good and friendly. The hotel is still new and very clean and comfortable. As with most Singapore hotels, the rooms are not as big as you would find in other countries but Dorsett has quite comfortable rooms for the prices. There was no bathtub but the shower was good. Another plus is the location, situated right on top of Outram MRT station provides easy access by subway and trains. It is also located right at the start of Chinatown and provides a good location to explore Chinatown while being far enough to be quiet. There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance from the hotel. Travel to other parts of Singapore is easy by the MRT subway just beneath the hotel. We did not have breakfast provided but it was not a problem as there are plenty of restaurants and fast food a short walk away. Overall, this hotel excels with the service, friendly and help staff, clean and comfortable rooms, centrally located with easy access to train service.",

    "detail": "First time stayed in the same hotel for 2 weeks. Due to MCO, I was stranded in Singapore as we were not able to go back to my hometown-JB. I checked in to ST Signature Tanjung Pagar on 17 Mar and since then, I continued my stay at ST Signature Tanjung Pagar till 30 Mar 2020 for their wonderful customer service. I am impressed by the responsive customer service from the host, housekeeper and the manager. They did their very best to serve their customers. Feedback and suggestions were taken seriously by the Hotel Manager. I communicated to the hotel manager regarding how she can enhance the personal hygiene at shared toilet when she came to solve my room wifi connection problem. I suggested to her that it will be better if we can have the hand sanitiser at the hair blowing area outside the shared toilets. The next days, 2 bottles of hand sanitisers are placed on level 2 & 3.
