    "detail": "I have to say I am in love with the big windows it has in all the rooms. As you may notice, a lot of the Taipei hotels do not have windows in their room yet this one you can enjoy a great view of the busy Taipei. Besides, they have an iPad that allows you to control everything in the room with an app. Though you don't see the usual smart/butt-washing toilet but you get the smart lighting in your shower area in return. All in all, it's a nicely designed hotel which is also a good value for money. An obvious choice in the Taipei Station area.",

Just let them know of your needs, they are super nice! There is also a free breakfast buffet!!! Mind you in every night of your stay, your next day bfast is free! (Budget friendly~~) They clean and change towels every day (you have options to change sheets if you want to) They have english channels in TV, :D PS: shout out to Ms Cathy M who helps us with our wifi ordeal (we had issue with our rented wifi router from klook so they lend us wifi router for free!!!)",

But the capsule itself is clean. Everything you need is in there. You have a locker and you can fit in bags inside the capsule and still have enough leg room. AC is nice and cold. The bed is very comfortable. There's only one pillow, though, but I guess you can have it arranged if you want more pillows (at a fee?). The staff is very good in English and they are absolutely helpful. The toilet and shower are plenty and very clean. You don't have to wait to when you have to go. There's more than enough for the guests. The guests are polite. They respect your privacy and space. It's a very quiet area. I will definitely stay here again. It's a very safe space. As for location- the best! It's near the MRT (walking distance, 3-5 mins) and located at the center. Many uber in the area too.",

    "detail": "We went in group of 4 (3 friends and an elder mother) in a 7-day trip to Taiwan, with first three days staying at NYS LOFT HOTEL in Taipei. I would say that this staying goes beyonds our expectation for a three-star hotel. (1) Nice and helpful staff with fluent English. They even helped us exchange money at late night when we run out of cash and needed to go early on the following morning to Chiayi. They also allowed us to leave our big luggage at the checkin counter during 2 days we were on our trip to Chiayi. (2) Utilities: Free umbrellas to use whenever you need. Free coffee, tea (on self-serving). Spacious common room for kitchen and living room, with oven, glasses, dishes, and bows (wash yourselves after use). (3) Room services: quite spacious (in the description it writes 9 square meters for double room, but I think it is bigger. All facilities are modern and work well (hot water, air conditioner, mini fridge, mini bar, hair-dresser, etc.) and convenient to use; quiet and clean. We booked 2 rooms for 4 people, and both the rooms are excellent. (4) Location: excellent since it takes only 3 minutes walking to the City Main station. The neighbourhood is packed with lots of local shops, foodstores, convenient stores (7-11 stores, family marts, Life OK,etc. which open 24/7). I definitely book this hotel again for my next trips to Taipei as well as recommend it to my friends :) ",

Hotel is at the more expensive end of the range of Taipei hotels but I felt I achieved decent value for money all considering. Room for a couple was perfectly adequate, though did not appear as large as some photos I had seen in advertising. However this might have been due to the enormous bathroom taking a fair amount of the room space. I would neither describe the room as dated or modern, somewhere in between, but comfortable and always clean. Air conditioning was very good and quiet in operation. Breakfast was buffet style and comprehensive; I was very happy with it, the fruit juices were some of the best I have tasted. Staff need a special mention as they were consistently delightful, polite, friendly and always helpful (they could speak English though my partner can speak Chinese). Overall a very pleasant 8 day stay and I would visit again.",

This hotel is not only good location but also it was very clean and tidy. The room & bed was compact, but to me, there was no problem. I could stay so pleasantly. The first floor is coffee shop; wake up, go down stair, get a cup of offee easily, it is very nice. Around the hotel, there are food shops, book store and department store. You have got lots options to go&eat. ",
