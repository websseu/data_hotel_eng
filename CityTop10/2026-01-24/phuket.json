Room was not cleaned after my day trip returning 4-5pm in the late afternoon. Hotel is not customer-oriented, staff hardly greet when passes by. Asked for laundry or rental services just point opposite to hotel without any personal interaction (eye contact or greetings). Made an upgrade to my room type to pool facing for better view and brightness. Room was very dim in the night with little lighting, corridor is also very dimly lit at night. Highly recommend to get pool facing at high floor for better view. ",

    "detail": "Unbeatable 5 star resort on Phuket. Booked a 1 bedroom sea view, but upon arrival found out they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom penthouse. 150m2 appartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and 60m2 rooftop balcony. State of the art equiped with 3 lcd tv's, and 4 airconditioning units. Swimming pool great and restaurant excellent as well. The restaurant is relatively expensive, but that seems to be the trend for hotel-restaurants everywhere in Thailand. 2 minor points of criticism: - Each bed had 4 pillows, but all are of the same type. Rather hard and thick, while feathered pillows should be the standard. - The sea on this side of Phuket is not really made for swimming. Sand is very coarse and water shallow up to 300 meters from the shore. Keep in mind that these minor downsides are close to neglectable. We spend 1 month in Thailand, and stayed exclusively in 5 star accomodations, of which none came close to the Serenity Resort",

Shared female bathroom, they provide shower gel, shampoo and hair dryers. 5th floor is the nicest place to hang out with communal where you can lie in and watch DVD and kitchen area to order your food, you need to pay. A small lap pool and a view over looking the ocean. Free coffee and tea from 8am to 10am. WiFi is superb. Best place to stay if you are in Phuket. Highly recommended 👍",

They have nice grounds and a great pool (with the always tempting poolside bar), and the facilities were spotless. Highly recommended. Most hotels in Phuket are quite expensive, and we were apprehensive due to the low cost of this one. But it was really nice (and we're very picky about hotels).

    "detail": "Everything was great until we tried to book a taxi to the bus station. I asked for a taxi to phuket bus station terminal 2. the person behind the desk confirmed and said it would be 200 baht. i thought that was pretty cheap as grab was showing 650 baht so I asked again is that the price to go to phuket bus station, terminal 2? to which she said yes. the guy who was taking us in the taxi came and I asked him as well, to phuket bus station terminal 2 correct? and he said yes. 10 minutes later he tries to force us out of the car at a local bus stop that was 30 minutes from where we had to be. He told me I would have to catch the local bus to get there which ws ridiculous. It took about 10 minutes and I had to speak to his boss at the hotel several times on the phone to resolve. First they demaned I pay 550 baht more, which would make it 750 baht which is way more than the grab, so i said no and after a lot of back and forth, I had to pay 450 baht more making it the same as the grab.",

    "detail": "I’m easy to please. With that said, I have to give high ratings for this ‘great find.’ Price is more than reasonable. Good conditioned bicycles are free. Location is just fine. Prices high in the restaurant however a short bike ride into town will give you many choices of local food. I read another review that mentioned ‘this is the best hotel in Phuket’. Not sure about that but it is an absolute I will return here. My original 3 nights here turned into 7 nights. ",
