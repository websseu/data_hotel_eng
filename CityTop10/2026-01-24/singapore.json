    "detail": "First time stayed in the same hotel for 2 weeks. Due to MCO, I was stranded in Singapore as we were not able to go back to my hometown-JB. I checked in to ST Signature Tanjung Pagar on 17 Mar and since then, I continued my stay at ST Signature Tanjung Pagar till 30 Mar 2020 for their wonderful customer service. I am impressed by the responsive customer service from the host, housekeeper and the manager. They did their very best to serve their customers. Feedback and suggestions were taken seriously by the Hotel Manager. I communicated to the hotel manager regarding how she can enhance the personal hygiene at shared toilet when she came to solve my room wifi connection problem. I suggested to her that it will be better if we can have the hand sanitiser at the hair blowing area outside the shared toilets. The next days, 2 bottles of hand sanitisers are placed on level 2 & 3.

Was offered early checkin a payable room upgrade which did not opt for. Rooms were very clean and bed was very comfy but rooms are very small . With 2 luggages open there won't be a place to stand also but guess that's common in all hotels in Singapore. The best part of the hotel was the Handy phone which was provided which helped us during the stay and also book Attraction tickets with huge discounts. ",

    "detail": "I landed in Singapore with the first flight and got into the hotel as early as 10 AM and they let me checked in to my room, while other hotels in Singapore usually only allow me to get into my room at 2 PM. This helped me a lot to have a rest in the room a bit and refreshed myself before my meetings. The room is quite big and I can enjoy free mini bar in the room replenished daily with soft drinks, juices and mineral water. All free of charge! Very generous of them! All the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Bell Service and Concierge staffs are very helpful and work very fast on baggage handling and taxi queue. They responded immediately when I had problem logging in to the wifi connection in the room, I was planning couple of weeks before my arrival to have dinner at their Carousel Restaurant and I made reservation for the dinner online on the Carousel website. They always have waiting list for Carousel and all the food was SUPERB, fresh, and has very extensive choices, especially the seafood which I loved very much!! No wonder as Carousel Restaurant is voted as the Best Buffet Restaurant in Singapore by AsiaOne People's Choice Awards for 6 consecutive years !!! Amazing. I stayed there for 3 nights and had a last flight on my check out day. It has the best location right on the city center of Singapore and within walking distance to all the shops, restaurants and shopping malls in Orchard Road area. They let me use the Business Center for free after I checked out and enjoy free drinks there for couple of hours while waiting for my night flight. Thank you Royal Plaza on Scotts ! I will definitely come back and stay there again next time.",

The rooms are tiny but that’s very common in Singapore (as in many major cities around the world). Everything is very clean and designed to make the best out of the small space. The staff were very nice (and the robot who acts as room service was cool as well). I didn’t love the breakfast, not many options for plant-based eaters, but if you’re used to having eggs, meat and dairy in the morning you should be fine. The location is great - by a nice section of the river with many cafes, bars and restaurants. It is about 15 min walking distance from the nearest MRT station but the hotel also offers a free shuttle service to select locations in the city which makes it very easy to get around. All in all the hotel was great and we will definitely return to it next time we’re in Singapore. ",

As with most Singapore hotels, the rooms are not as big as you would find in other countries but Dorsett has quite comfortable rooms for the prices. There was no bathtub but the shower was good. Another plus is the location, situated right on top of Outram MRT station provides easy access by subway and trains. It is also located right at the start of Chinatown and provides a good location to explore Chinatown while being far enough to be quiet. There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance from the hotel. Travel to other parts of Singapore is easy by the MRT subway just beneath the hotel. We did not have breakfast provided but it was not a problem as there are plenty of restaurants and fast food a short walk away. Overall, this hotel excels with the service, friendly and help staff, clean and comfortable rooms, centrally located with easy access to train service.",

Bathroom and toilet are separate. Both are pretty cramp, just nice fit 1 person. Cleaniness can be improved as stains can be noted at the robes hanging area. The sofa on the lower level can be pulled out to be a sofa bed, hence can accommodate more than 2 persons in the room. The room is equipped with safety box, fridge, hairdryer and separate working table either on the upper or lower part of the deck. One thing to note is that public transport is not conveniently located near the hotel. For first time visitor to Singapore, it is advisable to travel around by taxi, which the hotel concierge staff can help to get.",

    "detail": "My family and I stayed at hotel boss for 4 days in a family room with balcony (good for 4 pax).Over all the hotel room is brand new since the hotel just started last year. Everything are still crisp. Staff are all nice, helpfull, accomodating and smiling. The location is great, there are 2 MRT stations near it (Bugis Statiob and Lavender Station) which is about 5 minutes away through walking and a bus stop just right outside the hotel door. Mustafa center and bugis shopping mall is near. There are also tourist attractions near the area like Haji Lane wall art and Mosques. There is a 24/7 fast food chain (food clique) within the hotel premises which I find convenient because you don't have to worry getting hungry after a long day walking around singapore. A money changer, convenient store, restaurants, winery, and souvenir shops are also in the premises. I just hope they would maintain its cleanliness and beauty. Our room is small though for a family of 4. Our big suitcases can't just be open all the time because it'll obstruct our walk way and there is no closet. And also you have to request for a Do not Disturb sign, sometimes they're running out of it. Room lighting is nice and the wall art at the bed frame is beautiful. The balcony is big and spacious. Bathroom is nice, and clean with amenities; no bidet spray though. Shower temperature is good. Room is complete with compact fridge, tv, safety box, water boiler, and compimentary coffee & tea. The bed is good, didn't feel any back pain and good fluffly soft pillows. Nice hotel amenities with their pool overlooking Singapore Flyer and the tip of Marina Bay Sands. Generally the Hotel is at great great location, brand new, best value for money, and comfortable place to stay. I would choose to stay at this hotel again once I'm back in singapore. I would rate this hotel 9/10 👏👏👏👍. My family had a great time and payment is hassle free thanks to agoda ☺️👍. Satisfied guest here! Great Job Hotel Boss! ",

Room also features a full-sized window view of the Singapore Expo area. Location of hotel is just a 5 minutes walk away from the Expo MRT station and no lack of amenities as Changi City Point is right beside it. Amazing value for money with the last minute promotion deal.",

    "detail": "We are so happy that we chose to spend 5 night a brand new Yotel. *The staff- Very polite caring and helpful. (the best staff we ever had in a hotel) They helped us with planning, adjusted for us the menu to our vegan twists, even cheak and printed for us information about an event in the city! *The location - Perfect location very close to ION mall and MRT station. we mostly used buses. it is nicer to see the city this way (bus stop is even closer and located in front of Thailand embassy) we also liked the hotel located on the beginning of Orchard street. it is very easy to take a bus to see all the street. Since it's a one way street you can get out each time in the stop you like. * The room - small as most rooms in Singapore hotels but designed very smart and functional! we felt like in a space-ship with cool view on the city skyline. * facilities - 10th floor is Amazing! the gym is very good and new! The restaurant is amazing with very good prices. We got a 50% discount for breakfast for choosing to eat only fruits and veges in the morning :) kitchen is open till 22:30 and we used to get nice evening vegan fruit and veges salad that was adjusted for us! Thank you so much for the warm hospitality. we relay appreciate every one of you! You are areal Pros! Best Regards, Daniel & Sarit ",
