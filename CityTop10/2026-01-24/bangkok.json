Do not expect shopping malls within walking distance of the hotel, as I said it is out of town. Lots of very local food courts and vendors stalls on the roadside, all very good value local food, but again don’t expect pineapple rice and mango salad, this is real local Thai food, not tourist food. Unless like me you enjoy real Thai basic food. There is a reasonably priced restaurant in the hotel if you want it. The hotel staff were very good and the breakfast was ok, I will stay there again on my business vists. ( it’s a 10 minute walk to the office).",

I was feeling lost and don't know what to do at that moment cause me and my girl friend doesn't speak Thai-language, also I don't even have a contact of my airline. So I went back to the lobby and looking for HELP. One of your staff which stay at Bell Captain side call Ping heard my situation and started help me to found out the number of the airline and talk with them about my issue. After all the conversation done, Ping suggest me to take the wrong luggage back to airport first and let BFS to handle my case. While we sent back the luggage and go to travel around, it was mid-night when we back to hotel. Another Bell Captain JoJo was there and I was asked for help to tracking my case. It was 8 hours later since I sent back the luggage and seems no luck on it as JoJo mention after he help to call the BFS. JoJo said he will stay connect with the BFS and let me know any update if need. Finally, BFS call me one hour later and said mine luggage was back to the airport and will sent back to the hotel I live! The next day I go back to Bell Captain, NJ saw my letter which provide by the hotel and already know what am I think of. My luggage is back! It's really amazing on all of you guys which help me on this ultimate-scared case and I think the training and the empathy of your staff are very well. I will recommend all my friend who will be BangKoK to travel to come to Pullman Bangkok Hotel G ! Also, a concierge staff call OFF also help us to contact the Van we book cause the time on my booking time is complicated. Thanks for his help too. Finally, i was received a cheat call from bangkok, thanks for your staff GAM to help me translate and let them know we are not worth to cheat. Again, thank you so much for all of your staff which helps. ",

    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part. Room service food could be improved, but it was really cheap so I can't complain. The view from the high floors is quite nice so that was a positive as well. ",

    "detail": "I plan to return to Siri Sathorn before I leave Thailand and will make it a base for future visits to Bangkok. Quiet location, but easy walk to shopping, nightlife, Saladaeng Station and beautiful Lumpini Park. You can get a free shuttle too. All staff were very attentive, helpful and delightful. When my adaptor caused a fuse to blow, repairmen arrived within a couple of minutes of reporting it to recception and it was fixed immediately .Buffet breakfast and lunch were great. Gym is well equipped. But the highlight for me was my deluxe room, which was very spacious and comfortable and had a kitchenette as well. I got an excellent deal, which made it extremely good value for money. I visited friends in a much pricier Bangkok hotel and came away feeling I had made the better choice. I will certainly recommend Siri Sathorn to other visitors to Bangkok.",

    "detail": "OK, it is rare to have a hotel in bangkok where smoking is allowed and it was quite a stay for us. It was very quiet hotel too so you can sleep well at night. It was not a bad hotel at all. For that price, I think it is all worthwhile. I would give five stars if they gave me bottle water the first day when I checked in, so next time, give me water! LOL... Roberson is nearby and so as all transportation. If you are looking to snack shopping, Roberson can fulfill all your snack needs. There were quite a lot of nice restaurants nearby and across the road as well. And there is an old book store nearby and it was a germ! I would definitely stay in this hotel next time. My suggestion, probably better ventilation before check in, it was quite hot in bangkok with the sun shine directly, no amount of air condition can cool the room down in an instant. Also, better television, it was almost impossible to watch anything, the reception was very bad.",
