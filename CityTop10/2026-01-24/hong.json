    "name": "Mini Central",
    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America.

    "detail": "How should I begin to write? This is not my first time staying here. I'm very picky person and has stayed in many five stars hotels in Hong Kong but none others could match this one. That's why I keep coming back. This trip to hotel I forgot my Mobile phone on the taxi. Soon after I checked in I realized I've lost it! The concierge kept calling my cellphone and finally reached the driver after 4 hours of attempt on calling the driver. They managed to get my phone back the next day! Everything in this hotel is spotless, the cleanliness, the check in and out process, they even walk you to the car and greet you upon departure. Oh and the room that I was upgraded was very spacious. All this make me feel like coming back home every time. I visit Hong Kong. What more can I say?",

    "detail": "I had an amazing stay at Harbour Grand Hong Kong hotel. I was unable to accomplish all my tasks during a day's business trip to Hong Kong, therefore had to make a last minute booking. Because of the Chinese Dragon Boat festival, all Hong Kong's hotels were very expensive and busy that day, and the price for a 3 star hotel was almost the same as the price I found on agoda for the Grand Deluxe Harbour View with FREE Internet room at Grand Harbour Hong Kong. I decided to go ahead and book the room. Upon my arrival I was warmly greeted by the hotel staff and the check - in process was very smooth. I was pleasantly surprised when the receptionist told me that I've been upgraded to a suite. When I walked in the room I was surprised by the size and comfort the suite had.It felt like I've won the lottery for a night. The comfort of the suite made me feel like home away from home. The gym,swimming pool and other facilities were also great. I will certainly recommend this hotel to all my friends and will stay again on my next visit to Hong Kong. ",
