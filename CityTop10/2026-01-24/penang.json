Breakfast was gorgeous (2nd Floor) & lounge at 29th Floor is highly recommended if you love music & hang out with your loved ones. Didnt use the swimming pool & gym but the view from the rooftop is GREAT! Love the amenities in the bathroom. However, being concern on environmental issue, the management could consider to provide body soap, shampoo & conditioner in dispenser instead of mini tube to avoid creating more single-use plastic waste. Will be back to stay at Jazz Hotel again if going to Penang, provided the standard does not drop as time goes by. ",

    "detail": "1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk, street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road! Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang. The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!). We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning. And were we glad we did. We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you! Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up",

    "detail": "St.Giles is tallest hotel in penang, view from our room is KOMTAR Building, and sea. My daughter love to stay in this hotel because they have free popcorn in reception. This hotel is very near to 1st avenue mall, and this mall connected to komtar and prangin mall, just walk turn right. If you turn left, we can get to GAMA supermarket, which have cheaper prices than others and also we can go to new lane food hawkers, macalister road zim sum which sell dim sum, atek durian...etc. Easy check in and check out.
