I ordered an amazing cocktail to the pool - a raspberry Tom Collins. Great business centre to print boarding passes. A+! ",

    "detail": "AT first glance, the hotel has a very modern chic new look, a place for urbanites with a Starbucks right at the lobby. A great feature for those accustomed to their regular Joe's even away on vacation. The lobby/reception area is spacious unlike most Bali hotels, with a few helpdesk. However, the check-in was a bit slow (couldn't find my booking) but everything was sorted in the end. The room was a pleasant surprised, everything looks clean, crisp and modern, albeit the size a bit smaller than usual. Amenities are adequate, i especially like the ziplock bag with tooth brushes and 2 tubes of toothpaste, which i can reuse for future travels. WIFI was excellent in the room and generally the whole hotel. I managed to do my work without any interference. One qualm about the hotel though, some of the staff (bell & security) seems to practice double standards, favoring the foreigners and ignoring the Asians. This was tested twice when i tried to get a cab, the staff opted to help the foreigners first, even though i was first in line. ",

Everything runs with a system. Not much waiting required. I have stayed in 7 different 4* hotels in Bali and this is by far one of the best value for money and comfortable one. Located in a quieter spot in seminyak but 10 minutes drive from seminyak square. I like that because you don't hear loud music or traffic. Walls are generally thin so if your room is near the lift lobby, you can hear conversations or footsteps. Pick a room further away from the lift if you are a light sleeper. Service staff are generally nice and warm. They will provide assistance in a jiffy without having to wait Long. I avoid breakfast in the hotel not because it's not good but I love to venture cafes. The breakfast selection in the hotel is decent. ",

We booked a unique room which was brilliant - balcony, large comfy bed, great flat screen TV with heaps of channels, lots of space and great bathroom. The wifi at the hotel is fab, you only have to log in once a day. There are 5 swimming pools at this hotel, the flying pool is a little piece of heaven. The hotel is spotless, very clean. No matter what time of the day we left our room, within an hour of returing the room had be cleaned, fresh towels and complimentary water everyday. The location was great for us, 10 minute stroll to double six beach and all the bars. We took the complimentary buggy ride to the beach where the hotel has private sun beds for guests to use in the best location, they also provide free beach towels too. A ten minute walk in the other direction will take you to the Main Street in Seminyak. The buffet breakfasts in the hotel where a triumph, so much choice and the staff, every morning so friendly. The pizza restaurant was joy!! Awesome Italian style pizza, beautiful fresh salads, nice wine and great service. On the street where the hotel is located there are also a number of bars and restaurants, an awesome bakery and coffee shop, as well as spa's and a mini mart and circle k right on the doorstep - so convenient. We extended our stay for a further couple of nights, and stayed a week in total and we still don't want to leave. I have to commend the management for hiring such great people, the staff here are all so wonderful, always a smile and a hello and eager to help with anything you need. Having stayed in many hotels in Bali, the Harris is the highlight for us, and we can't wait to come back. Our friend is getting married and we have recommend the Harris to all our friends also coming to bali for the wedding. Thank you for such a wonderful stay ðŸ˜ƒ",

Wish we stayed longer at this hotel as we only stayed 3 nights . Will book this hotel again in the future . Staff were friendly too. Cons : the lobby is airy so you will get some bugs here and there which is normal in Bali so just make sure you keep the door shut so they donâ€™t enter the room.
