    "detail": "My wife and I lived in Hong Kong twice, for a total of four years. For most of that time we lived at mid-level on the Victoria side, and we loved the view we had, day and night. There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

    "detail": "From Sept 15th to 17th, I stayed in this wonderful Hotel together with my wife and 4 colleagues (we were on a company trip). This is my 3rd trip to Hong Kong and I must say although I paid much more for the previous 2 hotels in Hong Kong Island, but this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in Hong Kong or anywhere else! From the airport, we chose to take Bus no. A31 to take us to the hotel. The bus journey took about 55 minutes and we arrived at the hotel at about almost 8.00 p.m. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a very pleasant and friendly receptionist at the hotel who had so kindly agreed to upgrade my 3 original Standard rooms at Tower 1 into one room at Harbour View - Tower 2 (on the 85th floor!) and another Family suite room at the 82nd Floor for my 4 other colleagues! The view at both our hotel rooms were phenomenal! And I really loved my Harbour View room as the design was modern and nice and the King size bed was very comfortable. However, special mention needs to be given to the Family Suite Room here - it is Really Spacious and beautiful. There were 2 Queen size beds plus 2 single beds in the suite and it has everything- a fridge, 2 round tables, kitchen cabinets etc! I really think the hotel has been extremely generous to exchange this suite room with my original 2 standard rooms at tower 1! Meals were not a problem at all as there are very nice dim sum and chinese restaurants in and nearby the hotel. The Tsuen Wan West MTR station was also very nearby the hotel (about 15 minutes walk away) and during my 2 night stay there at the hotel, I did discover that the prices of food and other stuffs at Tsuen Wan were really much cheaper than that at Hong Kong Island. If ever I were to go to Hong Kong again, I will definitely return to stay at L'Hotel Nina et Convention Centre!",

    "detail": "The Burlington was a pleasant surprise! Most hotels in Hong Kong are expensive and relatively small, and this was small, but it was great quality at a great price. It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

    "name": "Royal Park Hotel",
    "detail": "This is the first time my husband and I went to Hong Kong for our vacation out of the country. I was a bit worried because I am not sure where is the best place to stay and how to go around Hong Kong. I have heard that Taxis can be very expensive and we are not used to taking the bus. So the only option is via MTR. My sister recommended Royal Park to us since she and her family have been staying with Royal Park a number of times already. She has nothing but praises and tips when staying in Royal Park and in all her stays she has never encountered any problems. So I booked Royal Park here in Agoda and mentioned some requests like the bed type and non-smoking rooms be provided to us. We had a very early flight and arrived at the hotel around 11AM which is way before check-in time. I went to the reception and registered. We were advised to leave our bags so we can explore Hong Kong while waiting for the 3PM check-in. I was asked if we were on our honeymoon and I said no, just for vacation. We were registered and I was told to come back to reception to get the keys from 3PM onwards. The reception and concierge staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were able to explore Hong Kong and got back to the hotel around 7PM already. There are now different set of reception staff so I approached a random staff and gave her my Agoda printout. She checked on the computer and I saw that she went to a pile of neatly arranged keys and got the one for us which has a note attached to it. We were advised that all our requests were approved and we were given a room upgrade! She then asked us what time we want our complimentary red wine to be brought up to our room! Our tired feet forgotten, hubby and me were so happy! In our 3D2N stay, we had the convenience to have access to quite a number of interconnected malls and to the MTR! Hassle free stay! We had a wonderful stay and would stay at Royal Park again on our next trip to Hong Kong.",

Although it is quite far from shopping and attractions, it is very accessible by MTR (Ngau Tau Kok Station) therefore, location is not an issue. Forte restaurant is by far one of my best dining experiences in Hong Kong at affordable prices. Overall the hotel is really very good value for money. The rooftop pool is also beautiful, offering good view of the city. They also offer free mini-bar refreshments and a free shuttle bus to Kowloon Airport Express Station.",
