The hotel lobby set-up is simple and clean. We reached Aloha Hotel at about 10.30am on our first day in Hat Yai and were allowed to check in early. We were also able to have late check-out at 2pm upon request on our last day of stay. Both check-in and out procedures were swift and took not more than 5 mins each. The double bed room which we booked was found to be very clean and well kept, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, it is a good choice and strongly recommended.",

    "detail": "My needs were unusual - I was a bicycle tourer meeting another one in Hat Yai. My bike was too big to fit in the lift easily (though I could have done so as I have at many other hotels, by lifting the front wheel up) but they asked me to park it in their office where they could keep an eye on it as well. It remained safe throughout my stay. One of the Concierge was very helpful and arranged a massage and so on for us. The hotel itself is old but comfortable and clean. My only issues were that the light at the bed head was not working (old LED strip) and the shower water temperature was hard to control so I had very hot showers. Still, they were not serious issues to me and I enjoyed my stay. The location is great and near my favourite pub in Hat Yai, Post Laser Disc, and also to some other sites like markets and even the railway station. ",

She also drew a map for us to the best Thai beef noodle shop near our hotel. We followed her simple map, made a few wrong turns, asked a few local stall holders and shop keepers and eventually found the famous Thai beef noodles in a corner shop opposite the BP Grand Tower hotel ! What a treat for us, it was the best beef noodles dish we had ever tasted in Thailand. We went back to eat the same beef noodles every afternoon during our time in Hat Yai. The hotel breakfasts were surprisingly good, we particularly liked the American breakfast. All in all, we had a VERY NICE stay at the Golden Crown Plaza Hotel. We will definitely stay in this hotel again in August when we travel to Hat Yai for another holiday.",

It took about five minutes by cab to the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised considering the low price. The bell boy took our luggage to our room which was huge with a king bed that was so good to sleep on. There was a minibar, the bathroom was clean and well equipped. The next day, reception organised a bus to Krabi town for us and made everything easy. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",
