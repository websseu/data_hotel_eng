    "detail": "1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk, street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road! Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang. The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!). We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning. And were we glad we did. We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you! Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up",

I wanted to mention this because we ran into a nicely dressed gentlemen who must have been the general manager in the elevator and then outside the restaurant.

    "detail": "This newly built hotel is in the heart of Georgetown - within walkable distance to various night food markets. The view from the hotel is also magnificent, especially the view from the pool. I booked a family room however only realized at site that it is actually two individual rooms connected via a connecting door. And the connecting doors between two rooms open at a weird angle and no door stopper was provided - hence would recommend getting the suite instead for better and more comfortable stay. Check in process was extremely slow most likely due to the crowd during the christmas weekend. However I was extremely unsatisfied with the way the receptionist handled the situation. First I was informed upon arrival at 3.30PM (Noted check in opens at 3PM on the website) that the room will be available in 10 minutes. And yet my family and I waited for an extra 40 minutes until 4.20PM for the rooms. And there were no updates from the receptionist in between the wait. In the end I voiced out my unsatisfactory to the hotel team and was then only been provided with free breakfast for the next morning. In my humble opinion I appreciate honesty in customer service. The receptionist should be honest with the waiting time in order for customers to then make better choices with this spare time - we could have spent the waiting time at a nearby cafe/tourist attraction site instead. This was the only downfall of my stay. Otherwise the check out process was smooth, the hotel's rooms are great, parking is provided with automated car park and other hotel staffs I encountered were friendly and helpful too. ",

    "detail": "I am really touched by the smile and the services of the workers. We found Armenian Street Heritage Hotel when we have our refreshment beside. We are trying to look for a clean and comfortable room with good price while walking around Penang. Once we found Armenian, we thought that the prices will be really expensive. But once we get to know them, we realise that the price is quite affordable while the environment and services are really heart touching. Before we do the booking, the bring us to 3 rooms to have a look. They never hesitate to reply our doubts and questions. We feel like home coming as they treat us like an honourable guest although we have only done a booking for one night. Two thumbs up for Armenian and definitely 5 stars rate for overall services. The best out of the best. ",

The check-in and checkout were hassle free (cannot recall the front desk staff names)and better still the greetings and smiles made me felt very welcome ... I love the car park located on Level 2 & 3. I can access the Lobby Lift and go straight up to my room (via choice of 4 very fast Lifts). Oh yes the Dragon, constructed using recycled mineral water plastic bottle is still being displayed in the Lobby. Great for photos!",
