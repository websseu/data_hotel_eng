    "detail": "Stayed in this hotel for three times already, and I will definitely come back again . The location is good, just across NAIA terminal 3 (they provide a free shuttle bus every hour from the airport to the hotel. You can find the buses at the arrival gate at the ground floor of the airport). There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

    "detail": "This is one of the pricier hotels in Manila as it's near the international airport. My favorite thing about our stay in the hotel was the rooftop view from the top floor of the hotel where the pool was also located. You can lounge there while enjoying the view. They also have a sauna and a gym. The staff was also very helpful. They immediately helped me when I got locked out of my room because the automatic doorknob needed a change in battery. The food at the restaurant was delectable. There's a Starbucks on the same building of the hotel and there are a couple other restaurants around the Resorts World area which are easily accessible from the hotel. This hotel accommodated our last minute booking because our supposed first booking at another hotel also got cancelled last minute. Anyway, this hotel turned out to be better than we've expected and it's a great value for your money.",

    "detail": "The hotel is modern and tidy. The rooms are a bit small, but not cramped. I have been in much smaller hotel rooms. Bathroom was ok, however the water was only luke warm. I did not ask them to fix it. When we checked in, I explained that I had booked 2 nights, but I would be staying only one night, and the second night my wife would like her friend to stay over for company. Initially, they wanted to charge 1000 Peso, but after a bit of chatting they agreed to waive it. After all, we were not having extra people stay, no additional numbers for breakfast. The one gripe I do have, and hotel please take note: I went to have a drink of water from the supplied water bottles, and it tasted terrible. I looked closer at the bottle and it said Natural Drinking Water. So that means Tap Water, or water from a well or lake. Now I have drunk tap water in Davao, and its clean and tastes ok, but in Manila?? No way. Bottled water is cheap, so why not just have distilled water?? Surely that is better, and safer for your guests. ",

    "detail": "Location, Location, Location... I’m Hotel is the perfect location for a 4 star hotel since it’s in Makati area and if your looking for central area to roam north or south of metro Manila, then I’m in the perfect place for you. So now let’s nit pick, room was clean and no weird odor which is a must. You even get a welcome cake when you enter your room which is a nice touch. Sheets was clean and didn’t seem worn so that a plus. Bathroom has a glass see through from the bedroom which is starting to trend amongst 4-5 star modern hotels but where I’m fails is the design flaw in the bathroom. The floor is flat so water starts to flood after a few minutes which is a fail. Also notice some spots the room attendants missed cleaning in the bathroom which is taboo for 4 star hotels. Shower pressure is strong and hot so thats a plus. Room service food is not bad either, fast and food was great. Roof top bar is fancy and that mixologist makes a mean bloody merry that is very rare find in Philippines. Overall I’m still comfortable giving IM HOTEL a 4 star rating. If you can get them under 5k Pesos or under 100 dollars a night then this place is really worth it . I personally wouldn’t go past that rate.",

    "detail": "This a very new hotel in Manila, perfect for solo or double traveler/s. The room is clean, i love the bed, the pillows are thick and the comforter is like what you found in a 5star hotel. Very comfy! The aircon is big, quiet and ofcourse new! So its very cold. The toilet is quite big, very clean with hot shower and dryer. I like the view from the window, I suggest you to get the ocean view for a great sunset. Its very relaxing. The staff are very courteous. If you want to go to the mall, robinsons manila is 5-10mins walk, or you can take a taxi if you dont feel like walking. Mall of asia is 15-20mins away by taxi. If you have time to get around, theres a lot of good restaurants and bars around the area. The downsides are they only have one chair in the room, they dont offer room service and they dont have restos (as of now, I dont know if theyre planning to have soon), sad to say. If you want to eat and you dont want to go far, there is a conveniet store beside the lobby. ",
