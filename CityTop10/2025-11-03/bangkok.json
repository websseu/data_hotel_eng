    "name": "Boss Suites Nana",
    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

    "detail": "Hotel overall was great. Staff was very pleasant. Only thing is the location I would consider very far from central bangkok. Takes roughly 20mins++ bts if you intend.to go from hotel to BTS Siam and longer if you intend to go to Jatujak. Going by Taxi would be costly. The hotel would be ideal if you intend to go to Mega Bangna as you can get there by going to BTS Udom Suk and then taking the free shuttle bus from there. Another thing is walking from BTS Bangchak to the hotel is quite a distance so I wouldnt recommend anyone with a family or have problems walking due to the inconvenience. That aside we had a pleasant stay at the hotel. Would be great if the hotel could provide a buggy ride (i saw a buggy outside which was never used maybe for decor only) or some other form of transport to pick customers up from BTS bangchak to the hotel and back.",

    "detail": "This was the final of the six places I stayed in Thailand whilst traveling around the country . I stayed here for nearly a week. This place is newly re-furnished and thrives because of its staff and location. The staff are great and look after you as if you are family. They give great information on both local and national places of interest and also drew me out maps on occasions on how to get to places! Spending the late evenings learning Thai at reception (well counting to 5) was an added bonus as well as the shopping/markets/ travelling advice that I was given. The rooms were clean and have lockers. The location is very central with a BTS station less than a minute walk away that takes you to major places as did the boat that I took. The hostel is also in a great location to get the BTS 40 minute train to/from the international airport. This was a great place to stay and if I come back to Bangkok again, this is where I will be based. Thank you.",

    "detail": "A regular visitor to Thailand I stayed in the excellent Ambassador Hotel on Soi 11off Sukhumvit this time. I say excellent because the standard is exactly how a €40+ per night 4 star in Bangkok should be.The Ambassador is a big property with many amenities. The reception area is huge and the staff are friendly and efficient. My luggage was taken from the Taxi and appeared in my room within minutes of me entering my room.The initial impression you get when you walk in to the reception area is 5 star but the rooms put it firmly back in the second division.They are not bad but quite basic. Everything works and at this price you can't ask for more. The WiFi is free and strong but does require constant re-entering of passwords which is annoying at first but you get used to it. Room cleaning is efficient and flexible. Long low timber ceiling corridors give it a kind of old cruise liner feel. Restaurants, Bars, Massage studio, Gym, Tailoring shops, health spa and several coffee shops are among it's many features. And of course that great location close to everything. Some of the best restaurants in Bangkok are here.The very expensive but superb El Gaucho Steakhouse,one of 2 in the area, is right next door. For Mexican try the Coyote across the road. And round the corner the Firehouse serves the best burgers in Bangkok. An Aussie Bar also across the road serves up the traditional full breakfast. I would recommend the Ambassador as a budget hotel without hesitation. ",

    "detail": "On my last visit in June, I stayed at NANA Hotel for 5 nights and I'll say straight up..., I don/t mind this hotel at all..., it represents excellent value for money and for a very long time it has been the best and most centrally located hotel to take advantage of the Nana Entertainment area. I've talked to many other guests when I have stayed here and they pretty much all come back to stay, year after year..., making the NANA Hotel's clients probably the most loyal guests of any Bangkok hotel. The NANA has a large and very clean pool with plenty of day beds and shade...., theres also an attached large bubbly spa pool surrounded by thick greenery. The breakfast is also quite nice and the staff very efficient. I usually stay in one of the cheaper rooms and it is always well cleaned. I intend returning again in 3 months.",

    "detail": "I stayed at this hotel last May 13 to May 17, 2018. I arrived late around 1:30 am, check in was smooth but I was placed in the 4th floor even I requested a lower floor cause of my surgery on my knee. I was told that all the rooms were booked and they would move me the following. The following day I met Magali, I guess she was the owner and she moved me to the 2nd level. She was very thoughful and help me how to get around Bangkok. Her customer service was exceptional where she even surprised me with a cake during my birthday which was greatly appreciated. I was very pleased of my stay at Khaosan Art Hotel and I would very much recommend this place. Only cons is bed is a little bid hard, other than that it was a wonderful stay. I also missed their Pizza, I heard they have the best pizza in town.",

    "detail": "This is definitely my favorite hotel in Bangkok for now. The location is perfect - right on Silom road, close to BTS. Rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. The locked balcony is a bit disappointing but I think this is a kind of government recommendations. The bathroom looks cool with those glass walls. Good service. No annoying phone calls before the checkout. Housekeeping is always courteous and attentive. Nice swimming pool on the rooftop with a stunning view. I didn't like breakfast, but the good thing - I didn't pay extra for it. But if you should - just don't, the breakfast doesn't worth it (except coffee maybe). I can say this hotel is one of the best price+quality combos in the entire Bangkok. You will not be disappointed. ",
