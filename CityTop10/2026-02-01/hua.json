    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

Love the breakfast and coffee, staffs at the restaurant were very nice. Two nights were too short, will come back and stay here in my future visit to Hua Hin. Beautiful place to stay, short walk to the beach and easy to get grab car to go anywhere in Hua Hin. Thank you very much to all the lovely staffs at Resort De Paskani for making my stay a memorable one.",

    "detail": "I came back to this hotel after a couple of years, as I remembered this is one quality hotel in Hua Hin and it still delivers exceptional service as the same. I stayed during the week to avoid too many people, which is work because it was so calm (last time I booked it was a bit busy as in high season). My room get upgrade to pool view on 4th floor which is great, thank you to the staff, the building facing the sea but I couldn't see as the floor is too low. The hotel has good facility which is well maintained, and amenities in room are all comfortable, I wanted to extend my stay but I might need to check out and wait for check in time, so I pull back the idea. Breakfast are nice, I'm still impress with various choice and presentation of buffet line. Staff are also very attentive, from the entrance to the lobby and all area in the hotel. The down side would be the distance from town and away from beach, I drive so there's no problem. I definitely will come back again.",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

    "detail": "I am not sure if I have a high expectations or not but I paid a lot to stay at Vala. First, I was expecting that it will located near by Hua-hin but it is actually Cha-am, ok not so bad I can accept that because it was right close with the beach. I booked sea view room but I got to stay on the second building which actually a pool view room and can see the sea from very far with the diagonal angle The room was very nice and clean with a huge king size bed, the rest room is not so big but the water flow is very nicely Breakfast, I expect ed to have a nice breakfast with the ocean view but unfortunately, everything is not hot, I am not sure how they warm up the food but it was cold except the egg menu because they fresh making it. It is like so-so to me and not worth this amount of money, I would rather stay at mass hotel with this amount of money ",
