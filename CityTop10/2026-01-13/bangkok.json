Do not expect shopping malls within walking distance of the hotel, as I said it is out of town. Lots of very local food courts and vendors stalls on the roadside, all very good value local food, but again don’t expect pineapple rice and mango salad, this is real local Thai food, not tourist food. Unless like me you enjoy real Thai basic food. There is a reasonably priced restaurant in the hotel if you want it. The hotel staff were very good and the breakfast was ok, I will stay there again on my business vists. ( it’s a 10 minute walk to the office).",

There were no reviews but we figured why not give it a go. The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

I was feeling lost and don't know what to do at that moment cause me and my girl friend doesn't speak Thai-language, also I don't even have a contact of my airline. So I went back to the lobby and looking for HELP. One of your staff which stay at Bell Captain side call Ping heard my situation and started help me to found out the number of the airline and talk with them about my issue. After all the conversation done, Ping suggest me to take the wrong luggage back to airport first and let BFS to handle my case. While we sent back the luggage and go to travel around, it was mid-night when we back to hotel. Another Bell Captain JoJo was there and I was asked for help to tracking my case. It was 8 hours later since I sent back the luggage and seems no luck on it as JoJo mention after he help to call the BFS. JoJo said he will stay connect with the BFS and let me know any update if need. Finally, BFS call me one hour later and said mine luggage was back to the airport and will sent back to the hotel I live! The next day I go back to Bell Captain, NJ saw my letter which provide by the hotel and already know what am I think of. My luggage is back! It's really amazing on all of you guys which help me on this ultimate-scared case and I think the training and the empathy of your staff are very well. I will recommend all my friend who will be BangKoK to travel to come to Pullman Bangkok Hotel G ! Also, a concierge staff call OFF also help us to contact the Van we book cause the time on my booking time is complicated. Thanks for his help too. Finally, i was received a cheat call from bangkok, thanks for your staff GAM to help me translate and let them know we are not worth to cheat.

We visited Bangkok as first-time tourists and we stayed first in Arcadia Suites Phloen Chit for 1 night but we are not satisfied with the location, so we decided to transfer here in Eastin Hotel Sathorn for 2 nights. Location is convenient because it is just right there in Surasak BTS. This is just one station away to Saphan Taksin where the Central Pier in Chao Phraya River is located. From this pier, you can take the Express Boats going to the Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Asiatique the Riverfront. This hotel is ideal if you are going to visit these spots. But if you are in Bangkok for shopping, I suggest you book hotels around Chitlom Station, near the Central World Shopping Mall and Siam Paragon. Room is spacious, clean, comfortable. The only one thing that is lacking is the toilet bidet. Our stay in Eastin is very relaxing and we appreciate the hotel comfort and ambiance a lot.",

The staff of the Grand Howard Hotel was very welcoming. The hotelroom was big, clean and had all comfort you need. We had a corner room in the 17th floor and could enjoy a spectacular view of Bangkok because of the very big windows. My children especially enjoyed the big swimming pool in the 6th floor. Part of it is roofed (protected from the sun) so you can use it at all day times. But the most we loved the staff of the hotel. They gave us good advice about what to see in Bangkok and they gave us a warm welcome every time when we returned to the hotel. We felt like being home. Thanks a lot to the staff of the Grand Howard Hotel!",

    "detail": "This is my 3rd stay at this hotel and I can say with confidence that this is the best hotel in Bangkok. I had several needs that this hotel quickly accomodated. We needed to book some tickets to Siam Niramit and I inquired at the front desk, next thing I know we were booked and they wanted to give us directions which I already had. This is a soup to nuts hotel, if you need anything it will be done. The suite is a wonderfully decorated and functional room. It will not disappoint. Love the bidet toilet seats by Toto and the quality fixtures. The bar is a great place to grab a drink and enjoy the city view outside. The breakfast has just about everything you could want, but I try not to indulge too much and everything is just so tempting. I enjoyed the wonderful pool with a view. The internet always worked. The keycards never had a problem. I had numerous packages delivered here. I had several VIPs in Bangkok visit me here. Never a problem with them handling very expensive packages nor taking care of my friends who were always impressed when they came to visit. I didn't have to worry about them being rudely treated. So after all is said and done, don't even think twice about staying here. This should be your first choice, you will not be disappointed. I've traveled to Bangkok so many times and stayed at so many hotels here and this is at the top of the list.",
