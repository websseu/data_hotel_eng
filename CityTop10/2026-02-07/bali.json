    "detail": "There are a lot of really nice things about the W but there are some downsides too. The good: The interior design is very well considered and we appreciated the details. Rooms were excellent, the communal areas were breathtaking and very ... 'cool' (horrifically general word but I think this is what they're intending it to be). The pools were nice and the restaurants were pretty well designed also. The best thing was the sunset - breathtakingly beautiful! Room service was reasonably good also, once or twice they forgot something but on the whole it was above par. The bad: The concierge Whatever whenever never worked - it became a joke that whatever whenever meant that they'd do whatever they felt like whenever they could be bothered. I think this was mostly because they were so understaffed that random staff trying to help jumped in and confused everything. Next, the outdoor areas are badly designed and tiny, for a hotel this size it needs at least 2x the outdoor space to function at a 5 star level. We found ourselves always messing around trying to find available poolside space as if it were a nasty 3 star all inclusive resort. There were no private places however I think if you take a villa you get some garden area but no beachside. The cocktails are totally watered down overpriced for bali. I know that this is an international grade hotel however the drinks to standard as you'd expect globally but were priced about the similarly Lastly: there wasnt really anything balinese, which was a huge shame. Bali is such a beautiful place-attitude, culture, art & craft, it would have been nice if some aspect of this was incorporated -this hotel could have been anywhere in the world as nothing of Bali really came through. Don't be put off, if you're looking for a place which is beautifully designed, beside a beach (where you cant swim) and amongst other premium grade hipster wannabes then this is really your home. ",

Very helpful and excited staff. Place feels luxurious. Super delicious with variety breakfast and room service. I complained about a neighbor being noisy and they did their best to control the situation and also offered me to sleep in a another room for the night. The next day, I found a hand written letter on my bed from the manager expressing his apologies, which really made me appreciate the customer service they have. ",

The only fault I could pick with this hotel was that the Internet in the room was not good. I need to work online now and again which I could not do in the comfort of my room. I had to sit in the restaurant for a good signal when I needed to do work. I found this problem in most of the 4 star hotels in Bali. Apart from that I enjoyed my stay",

The foods at the cafe of the hotel are good but price may be slightly higher to outside restaurant. But hey, its a 4 star resort. Haha. Everything is great except that; The floor is sticky, probably because of the water used to mop the floor The pipe water is from the natural sources, meaning that the water is a bit salty. So we did not have proper clean shower. Maybe its the specialty of the hotel that we did not prefer of. Again, would recommend this to others who wanted to have a good stay with affordable price!

    "detail": "i brought my parents for a 4d3n trip to bali for the first time and been looking for a suitable hotel and this was a last minute trip so i actually booked this hotel a day before arriving after going through several selection of hotels. kuta paradiso hotel is amazingly located at the most strategic location nearby kuta square and lots of eating outlets stone throw away. though the poolview indicates that you are able to see the beach, but in reality the scenery of the beach is well blocked by tall trees, so if you're getting deluxe poolview, expect just the poolview and nothing more. nevertheless, it is just by the beach, you can access to the beach through a side exit of the hotel (as you walk out of the lobby, immediately turn left to an area that looks like parking lot and you will find an exit). hotel has full facility, staffs from reception to bellboy to waiter/waitress were all very warm and welcoming, kudos for the very polite culture! the room is up to my expectation as what i would get of a deluxe room, and that comes with free buffet breakfast which has reasonable selection of american/local breakfast...the potato hashbrown simply the best! exit from the hotel, you will walk through kuta square and reaching a t-junction you may decide to turn left towards the road along kuta beach, or turn right to access to other roads namely legian street. you will get familiar on the first day itself so enjoy ;)",

    "detail": "The hotel is located very close to the airport, convenient for those who has to catch early flight the next day, and it’s best alternative to Novotel hotel at the airport with more than half the price. The room is quite spacious for Bali hotels’ standards with given price and quite clean. It has a large swimming pool. The staffs are polite, and they follow up my complaint about the not-so-cold AC after their engineer checked my room’s AC. Breakfast was standard, more choices than budget hotels for sure, but not that lavish. The restaurant has indoor seating for non-smoking tables and outdoor seating quite a distance for smoking tables, which is nice for non-smokers. Great overall experience and will definitely look forward to staying here in the future.",

    "detail": "the staff are fantastic and helpful. always smiling and willing to assist. the rooms aren't huge but the shower sure is. good little balcony also. the view from the ocean facing rooms is excellent especially if you are on the 4th floor. it is also really great to have free wifi that works well. breakfast is probably the best i have had at any hotel in bali, and i have stayed in many. the pool is lovely and the pool service is also very good. this hotel is a fantastic place to stay and is in a great location. being able to walk out to the beach and take the path north to kuta, instead of having to walk on the busy street is a nice, safe and relaxing way to get around. it is located next door to one of the best shopping centres in south bali. as centrally located as it is, it is still far enough away from the party zone of north kuta / legian, which is an area we are not interested in. love staying at the kartika and highly recommend it.",
