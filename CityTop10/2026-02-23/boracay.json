    "detail": "Boracay is definitely a great place for a short honeymoon, or a beach holiday. The people are all super friendly and both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

It has efficient and prompt shuttle services. We did not have to wait for a long time for the shuttles to arrive. Fairways has many of shuttles that are one call away. The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",

    "detail": "The Paradise Garden Resort Hotel is perfectly positioned between Station 2 and Station 3 on Boracay Island. The resort is quite big and runs from the street front to the Beach making it only 30-40meters from the water. Most of the hotels have a beach frontage which is a must when selecting a property in Boracay. The hotel has a wonderful restaurant on the beach front which is were you have your breakfast. Breakfasts cater more for the Chinese and Korean palate rather than westerners but lunch and dinners are great, especially the lunch buffet ($US12-13) which includes unlimited beers at that price. It has two pool areas and you can always find a banana chair most times of the day. From the hotel you come out on the beach side and walk along the sand to a really good selection of bars and restaurants where you can find dining options ranging from $10/person to as expensive as $50/person. You can get even cheaper in the traditional Philippino restaurants if your game LOL. ",

    "detail": "After we landed, things started off bad but once I was able to speak with the manager and staff, the rest of our time went great. The staff and management were wonderful. They should be commended! The hotel is in the perfect location and right on the beach. It is directly beside D-mall. The suite has great views, we highly recommend spending the extra money to enjoy amazing views with excellent privacy. We also highly recommend to utilize their transportation. When you fly to Boracay, you do not land on the island of Boracay. You have to find transportation to the boat dock, pay for boat transportation to Boracay and then find transportation to the hotel. OR If you book with the hotel, they charge you and extra $5 over the price you would pay on your own BUT you have private transportation from the airport to a private boat and the private transportation to the hotel. For $5 it is more than worth it, no hassle, no cramped and crowded public transportation. ",
