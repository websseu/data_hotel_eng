This reviewer has a habit of misbehaving in first-class hotels (although not for the bath tub) and he hereby apologises to all Cebu first-class hotels. The Agoda price for three persons was double the price for two persons. Agoda.com went on to find a cheaper price – for three persons - through one of its partners. The Agoda document said – to the hotel – that it – the latter – would be paid, not by Agoda but, through a third party. Upon check-in, with three persons for four nights, we were told, we had only breakfast for two. We didn’t mind. Upon check-out, the breakfasts for the third person were reimbursed.",

    "name": "Waterfront Airport Hotel and Casino Mactan",
    "detail": "For 20 years I have stayed 50+ nights a year in hotels in various parts of the world; mostly Europe and North and South America. I had used 4 or 5 star beach resorts on Mactan Island on 3 prior visits to Cebu. They were good hotels but had no soul. The staff were robotic - by rote answers to questions and, if something unusual was asked, the human equivalent of a computer page being unavailable. So I asked myself what I was looking for from a Cebu hotel. The answer was comfort, safety, a decent swimming pool and good transport links. The Waterfront Airport is what it says it is; a 3 star airport hotel where most customers will stay overnight after arriving or prior to departure from Mactan-Cebu Airport. However it is much more than that. I stayed in a Deluxe suite. This was actually three good sized rooms: a bedroom with double bed, TV and plenty of storage; a bathroom which had a bath with a flexible shower fitting and a separate shower room with a fixed shower; and, a lounge with TV, two seater sofa and 2 chairs, table, TV, mini-bar, two large windows giving views of the city and interior on one side and of the airport on the other, and more storage. Each room had a phone and air conditioning operating down to 18C. It made a quiet background hum causing no disturbance. Rooms are sound-proofed but planes can be seen and just about heard in the lobby area. The swimming pool is 28x12 yards and 3-4 feet deep throughout with a small area which is very shallow and suitable for young children. Complimentary towels are provided and there is a good quality gym adjacent to it. At weekend from 7-11pm a pianist and singer perform in the lobby lounge. Marina Mall is an 8 Peso jeepney ride or ten minute walk away. The hotel, although 3 star, provided terrific value for money, has staff who go out of their way to be helpful and I would recommend it to anyone looking for quality at a competitive price and a good base from which to explore Cebu, city and island.",

The service by the staff was amazing, room and housekeeping the best and food, off the charts. The best breakfast buffet ever and I'm serious, the Cafe is the best. If you want an experience like never before visit the Twighlight Rooftop Lounge. Keep up the great work Bai Hotel, I will be back again and again when I return to Cebu.

The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",

To top it all, the hotel houses one of the best casinos in the country. The hotel also has a duty free shop where guests can buy items for less than in ordinary stores. Another good asset of the hotel is the buffet breakfast they offer where a guest could choose from among a wide variety of food and beverages.

How many times have I found only cold water in the later evening - including the Bayfront hotel. So many hotels here go so far as to only turn on their water heater between ~7 and 10 AM Area is fine, unless you need to be close to the airport for an early flight. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They'll give you directions to stuff and also warn you if you'll end up in a seedy area.",

The SM hyper market is just across from the hotel and there are a lot of stores to shop and eat. I believe it is much safer than any other place in Cebu and not far from the airport. The employs are kind and breakfast was good for me. ",

    "detail": "i originally planned on staying at the quest hotel for a week, but ended up staying a month. value for money when i was here in may-june 2012 the value for money was incredible. i paid around us per night without breakfast. by comparison, the cebu marriott, was running around us per night – a little over twice the price, and i imagine no better quality. i looked at half a dozen hotels in cebu before settling on quest. other hotels in cebu running in the $50 - $60 range don’t even come close in terms of quality. and my high expectations were met after i moved in. location the location is great, right across the street from the ayala mall, which is the most upscale mall in cebu. ayala a good place to hang out with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops with fast internet connections. (unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",
