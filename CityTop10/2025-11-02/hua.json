    "detail": "We found Hisea Hua Hin Hotel by chance when we we're talking to a local across the street from the hotel. We told her that we're searching for another hotel to stay at for the remaining 3 more weeks of vacation in Hua Hin. She immediately pointed to Hisea Hua Hin Hotel across the street which according to her, just barely opened for business. We decided to check it out right there and then, and we were lucky to meet the owner himself who showed us around. Hisea Hua Hin Hotel is definitely a jewel of a find, for its highly detailed facilities, tasteful decor, furnishings, amenities, friendly and helpful staffs, and for the price! Additionally, the location is perfect and within walking distance to a lot of Hua Hin's city center places of interest, and the beautiful Hua Hin beach! We've looked at many hotels in the area prior to visiting Hisea Hua Hin Hotel and nothing beats Hisea Hua Hin Hotel for what it offers, the price, location, and the staff. Being that it's brand new, it's absolutely immaculate! Although it's low season and therefore it's not fully booked, I see housekeeping clean every rooms everyday! The beds are the most comfortable we've ever found during our 3 months of travel in Asia, and the owner accommodates our needs to the best that he can. Case in point, I wanted an electric fan in my room due to my special need for it, and he happily obliged without question although the A/C in his hotel works perfectly. The staff are very attentive and helpful, and the owner is a hands on kind of a businessman. He's always around and can easily be reached and easy to talk to. Now, this is not the Hilton or Centara, but it doesn't have the high price of those 2 either and for all the quality service and amenities Hisea Hua Hin offers, it just can't be beat! Lastly, I would like to add that I have worked for big 5 star hotels in Las Vegas as a V.I.P. Associate for 5 years, therefore, I know a jewel of a find when I see one when it comes to hotels, amenities,",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

    "detail": "As titled this is a brand new hotel, there isn't a sign from the main street to this hotel. Basically its next to Hua Hin Hospital coming down from Hua Hin Town towards Cha-Am. There's no sign on Phetkasem Rd (note to manager of hotel), you only see it once you turn in to soi 10. Hotel is not on the beach or tourist area, its basically in the middle of the main road between Cha-Am - Hua Hin. So if you want to get to anywhere you better have a rental or other means of transportation. There were only 5-6 rooms occupied when I checked in. So its very nice and quite. You seem to own the whole hotel complex. For The room, the finishing is OK and not really a 4-star. For me its more 3 stars, and as other reviewers the AC is really LOUD and also cannot get up to speed in terms of cooling. So better leave the key on when leaving the room unless you want to come back to a sauna. Swimming pool is small so I did not even bother, but do book a room with the jacuzzi on the terrace. Very nice for a quick dip. Breakfast was not a buffet style, understandable due to the number of guests they are still just opened recently. But with that the cook your own plate of A.B.F which is aplenty and very nice and fresh, the cooking lady even came out to greet us and ask about the food, which to me is a very nice gesture. Recommend this hotel if you are on transit or short stay in Hua Hin and plan to look around town/beach thus not staying much in-room. Not recommended if you want to stay and enjoy hotel facilities and all. ",

The hotel room is value for money, clean and looks very new. I think the housekeeping department made a very good job here. Location is just perfect. Just a few steps to Family Mart, a few minutes to Hua Hin Night Market and restaurants for food. Staffs are very friendly and soft spoken. You may hire Private cars to your desired attractions through the hotel too.The swimming pool was nice as well. And yes, the Sky Bar on the rooftop was a very relaxing if you want to grab some air. Thumbs Up and will come again if visit Hua Hin. ",

    "detail": "This is a late review, but I still remember every detail of my stay at Putahracsa. From the moment you step in the lobby the staff would welcome you with very friendly and genuine smiles. They are not shy to approach their customers to help out and definitely did their best at servicing their customers. Any requests you'd make they did their best to help out. The service was definitely a major factor for me enjoying my stay so much. Secondly, the hotel itself was very nice and relaxing. The environment was quiet and private with two beautiful pools. The rooms were comfortable and large. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the hotel was situated on two sides of the road. So to get to the second pool from my room I had to cross the street to the other side. This is only a minor problem tho as there was always a staff member near the street to help you cross the street. Other nice things about the hotel include the free DVD's they provide which is great for night time as Hua Hin is not a big party/nightlife kind of town. The hotel also has a tuk tuk which you can book to take you from the hotel to anywhere in Hua Hin. Although taxi's in Thailand aren't too expensive anyway, having this service saves you from the hassel of finding a taxi yourself. The hotel's location is also pretty good as it is within walking distance to the night market. (which I would deem as one of the major attractions in Hua Hin)",

    "detail": "I am not sure if I have a high expectations or not but I paid a lot to stay at Vala. First, I was expecting that it will located near by Hua-hin but it is actually Cha-am, ok not so bad I can accept that because it was right close with the beach. I booked sea view room but I got to stay on the second building which actually a pool view room and can see the sea from very far with the diagonal angle The room was very nice and clean with a huge king size bed, the rest room is not so big but the water flow is very nicely Breakfast, I expect ed to have a nice breakfast with the ocean view but unfortunately, everything is not hot, I am not sure how they warm up the food but it was cold except the egg menu because they fresh making it. It is like so-so to me and not worth this amount of money, I would rather stay at mass hotel with this amount of money ",
