    "detail": "Aloha Hotel is a brand new hotel well located in Hat Yai, and within walking distance to the major shopping belt & local markets, such as Lee Garden Plaza & Kim Yong Market. The hotel lobby set-up is simple and clean. We reached Aloha Hotel at about 10.30am on our first day in Hat Yai and were allowed to check in early. We were also able to have late check-out at 2pm upon request on our last day of stay. Both check-in and out procedures were swift and took not more than 5 mins each. The double bed room which we booked was found to be very clean and well kept, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, it is a good choice and strongly recommended.",

    "detail": "there is nothing like a good bed to sleep in after a hard days traveling. we were so happy when we go to the v.l. hatyai hotel in hat yai. it was a measly three blocks from the hat yai train station, up a road that had perfect side walks for walking people. the reception at v.l hatyai hotel was fantastic. people were happy, smiling, and most were able to speak english. the language barrier isn’t normally an important feature for us but after a very long day in minivans, ferries, buses, songteaws and on our feet it was a lovely surprise. we had booked our night in the v.l. hatyai hotel because of tripadvisor’s reviews and through agoda, who offered a very good rate for the room without breakfast. the room alone cost just under $30 usd without breakfast. when we enquired about the breakfast it would cost us 100 baht each, a whole $3 usd each. it was a fine breakfast too. bacon and eggs, yummy bread for toast, asian savoury delights, the makings for tuna salad, coffee, tea and milo, and for breakfast-dessert, bbq’d sticky banana rice in banana leaves. mmm! as we were so tired on the night of our stay we got room service. this is not ordinary for us but when we looked at the menu in our room the prices were so reasonable we didn’t feel the need to find a street food stall! how could a room service tuna salad only cost 80 baht? unheard of in a hotel. we ordered room service, pigged out on glorious food and watched english language television all night. the only downfall the v.l. hat yai had was that you had to purchase wifi / internet. the cost was reasonable, 20 baht for 24 hours of usage. if you could get it working that is. we found that the wifi worked best down in the lobby. all in all, the v.l. hat yai was a fantastic hotel. we really do recommend you consider staying there for one or two nights on your travels. break up that marathon journey between thailand and malaysia. you won’t regret it.

    "detail": "We arrived by train from Malaysia early in the morning and the hotel receptionist very kindly allowed us to check in. She also drew a map for us to the best Thai beef noodle shop near our hotel. We followed her simple map, made a few wrong turns, asked a few local stall holders and shop keepers and eventually found the famous Thai beef noodles in a corner shop opposite the BP Grand Tower hotel ! What a treat for us, it was the best beef noodles dish we had ever tasted in Thailand. We went back to eat the same beef noodles every afternoon during our time in Hat Yai. The hotel breakfasts were surprisingly good, we particularly liked the American breakfast. All in all, we had a VERY NICE stay at the Golden Crown Plaza Hotel. We will definitely stay in this hotel again in August when we travel to Hat Yai for another holiday.",
