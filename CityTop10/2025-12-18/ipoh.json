    "detail": "My son and I both really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Weil. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever tried. ALL the Staff are nice and helpful and service at every level and dept are ALL excellent. The room is very comfortable and also on the 10th floor room we had the view of Ipoh surroundings is very nice, and esp the surrounding limestone hills / mountains. Another big asset is the hotel is connected to the Ipoh Parade Mall which has many kinds of good restaurants. Note that the hotel and most others fill up on weekends -- evidently filled up because of local foodie tourists coming to Ipoh, even foodies from Singapore. Ipoh till now has its excellent food (reputation) basically everywhere. Ipoh main lacking though is ease of transport. Going out of the hotel is quite easy but not going back. So Weil Hotel location is a plus too since it is so central and many places are within walking distance. We got a local 3G data card for our tablet and used that to navigate the streets. All in all I think Weil is likely the best hotel in Ipoh now. Weil is setting the bar now for real value and excellent comfort. And then of course is the everywhere food in Ipoh -- a main everyday pursuit for excellent taste and tummy happy time !! ",

    "detail": "I was surprised at how centrally located the hotel was. Pub street was just behind, far enough so you don't hear the loud music from your room, but close enough to just take a 2 minute stroll to some of the best nightspots in town. It was also relatively near to a lot of the famous food shops. Two of the best dim sum in town are just a 4-minute walk away, perfect way to start your day. We took the triple room, and there was even a balcony. And the bathroom was so huge. Free drinking water too, just bring your own bottle down to the lobby to fill up. Also they had several reserved parking spots for guests at the back of the hotel, perfect if you are driving and do not want to pay for public parking by the roadside. I would really recommend this hotel, especially for other Malaysians making a short trip to Ipoh.",

    "detail": "I booked this hotel last minute for a staycation, I was impressed by the great hospitality that the front officers gave to me during check-in & check-out. They have free parking on the premises. The room, toilet, bed, floor are all clean except the desk in the room kinda dusty but thats okay because i bring my wet wipes to wipe it all. The thing that I like the most is the PILLOW!!! honestly, the best pillow ever, i feel like i want to buy the same pillow as this hotel hahahaha pls let me know where yall get the pillow bcs i would want to buy it for myself. Overall, it was a nice one night staycation in this hotel. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family to stay here when theyre in Ipoh. Thank you so much :)",

    "detail": "1st time stay in pi hotel. Fast check in and friendly staff. Only 3 things Im not satisfied was the room they gave me 810 have some problems - basin's mixer spoil with only hot water supply cause me brush teeth half way have to go into the shower area use the shower mixer. 2nd the body shampoo machine was out of service when I bath half way...damn! Cause me have to make a phone call ask them send me bath gel with a paper cup to my room and im on the middle of the bath! 3rd was the roon overall look like clean but actually have a lot of dust because i have a very sensitive nose. But at the end the staff shift me to another new room at 319 and thanks god everything was fine after shift into new room so just forgive them. The next morning when I woke up I leave a msg at reception counter ask them to do house keeping when I wanna go out, unfortunately during the night time when I back to my room the situation still same like morning without any house keeping. I purposely went down to reception to feedback and that time have 2chinese guys at reception and I dunno their name just can firgure out are one fat, short with spec and another one is tall n thin. They talk nicely and good manner apologies with their miss out service. At the end this 2chinese guys still send me a room service for their sincerely apologies make feel so surprise and forget about the mad and happy to see the humble nice service. So definitely I will come back again when I visit ipoh. Thanks for the room service and keep it up. Hope to see the improvement when my next visit soon. Thanks Oh ya, the hotel location very good because all the famous places and foods was just nearby and the best things I like is the hotel provides free car park with security for only guest. Reasonable price with not bad interior decor. This hotel also very good with provide the information with all nearby famous foods to convenience/easier guests from outstation to find the place. Good job!",
