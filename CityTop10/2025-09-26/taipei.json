This hotel is not only good location but also it was very clean and tidy. The room & bed was compact, but to me, there was no problem. I could stay so pleasantly. The first floor is coffee shop; wake up, go down stair, get a cup of offee easily, it is very nice. Around the hotel, there are food shops, book store and department store. You have got lots options to go&eat. ",

As you may notice, a lot of the Taipei hotels do not have windows in their room yet this one you can enjoy a great view of the busy Taipei. Besides, they have an iPad that allows you to control everything in the room with an app. Though you don't see the usual smart/butt-washing toilet but you get the smart lighting in your shower area in return. All in all, it's a nicely designed hotel which is also a good value for money. An obvious choice in the Taipei Station area.",

    "detail": "This being my 9th trip to Taiwan, I have stayed at a number of hotels from 5 star to 3 star. I would rank this as one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Taipei. I had orgininally booked for 3 days but ended up staying a total of 6 days. The location in excellent with the Ximen MRT station exit 5 just outside the hotel. The rooms are very modern and the bed is very comfortable. This is a new hotel and there are still some renovaitons in the lower level but nothing to be a hinderence at all to your stay. I have only some very small comments to make but once again nothing to be overly concerned by. The lip on the shower floor is quite low so the water does not drain away as quick so need to be careful of the water flowing over to the floor. While ther rooms are very spacious there is no where to put your luggage except on the floor maybe the room could have a stand that you can put your luggage on. The breakfast is delivered to your room from an external supplier. Not really to my liking as it was cold. I would have preffered maybe some pastries than the american style that was delivered.. My final comment and this is not a critisicm of this hotel but of most in taiwan. I would like to see an iron and ironing board in the rooms. Overall I must say I was very impressed with this hotel and the staff. I will definately be booking this hotel again on my next trip.",

If you are into local street food, there are also 24hrs hawkers to fulfil your midnight cravings. As for the service, very friendly and helpful front desk staffs. Interior design is one of a kind - modern and pleasant. As it is still new, everything is in order, and most importantly, clean. I hope that the cleanliness could be maintained even when the facilities get older. Only thing is that it is a little pricey (but hotels in Taipei are generally on the expensive side), and that there are no windows in the room. ",

    "detail": "Green World was an awesome find in Ximending, Taipei. I had previously stayed at 2 other hotels in Ximending but this hotel easily tops the list of my favourite hotels in Taipei. Hotel was spacious, clean and modern with a little quirk to the furnishings (you'll find floating sculptures of hot air balloons throughout the hotel area, and also a man holding a functioning light bulb in your room). Located 5min walk away from Ximending, you'll be able to find entertainment and food easily! A 7-11 is also located at the 1st floor of the hotel's building for any night owls craving for a tasty supper. For those commuting by MRT, the hotel is within a few minutes walk from Exit 5 of Ximen station. Breakfast offered a sizable variety of choices and was filling. The only problem I find with this hotel was its lift. Of the 2 lifts, only 1 services the 15th floor (which was the floor I stayed at). In the morning when guests are either checking out or going down to the 13th floor for breakfast, waiting for the lift could take quite some time. If you're lucky to be staying on the 10th floor (where some of the guest rooms are at), you'll have access to both lifts which could help cut down on the time spent waiting. Otherwise, everything else about this hotel is just perfect! I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Taipei!",

    "detail": "I think that was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed, on the price I paid. Staff were very friendly, including the bellboy, the front desk staff and the housekeeping staff. Only the restaurant staff may need to have more smiles on their faces, but they were quick in clearing used plates and cups etc though. Room was very well equipped and the beds were very comfortable. It was well equipped and the housekeeping was very good, cleaning our room and replenished used items without any issue everyday. The only issue may be that the lighting was not sufficiently bright. Another thing I wish to suggest is that since it was a room for 4pax, more privacy could be done for the bathroom and toilet. The hotel has a small but nice gym with a coin operated laundry next to it. On the lobby of every floor it has a display screen showing trailers of movies besides advertisement. Breakfast was reasonable with sufficient variety for us. Only suggestion was that the egg could have been changed between omelet, fry eggs and scramble egg. Location wise, nothing to complain as it was just next to an MRT station with plenty of taxis waiting in front of the hotel. Ximending shopping zone is just next to it and the famous Red House is just across the road. Just to highlight that, as for most of the hotels in Taipei, the hotel does not have a parking area neither a covered front porch. You will have to prepare your own umbrella to get out of your car if it is raining. But the hotel provides umbrella if you want to get out of the hotel though. As your car will have to stop at the roadside which is about 30feet from the hotel main door, you will have to prepare to carry your luggage as the bellboy only wait in the hotel main door. Alternatively you run into the hotel to call the bellboy out to help. Overall, I love the hotel and it is highly recommended.l.",

    "detail": "This has been our preferred hotel in Taipei since our first experience with them in Feb 2018. As such we hv also recommended to our friends in Spore. Their feedback was very positive. We were very happy to see familiar faces like Jack Nam -manager guest services division. As well as another lady at front desk. And Shaun -F&B on weekends only. Excellent service! Best attitude ever! Best part of room is comfortable pillows & bed. Strong shower pressure. Con- I wish they would work on putting a proper awning as we njoy outdoor spaces during the cold & rainy season. The door to the outdoor area has not been fixed since we were here last Feb 2018. The toilet & shower area in the room need some upgrading. We love Taipei so much that if they hv a laundromart we would consider staying one to two weeks here. Esp when we are close to so many good places to eat. MTR is less than 5min for those travelling with old folks or young kids ",

    "detail": "_First, I wish to send my warmest regard to all the staffs there. The service was brilliant. Upon collection of the access card to the rooms, these little envelope consists of the route map around the area for your easy preference, 2 access cards and the paper note for the access to free wifi. _Second, the place is only a 10min walk to Rao He night markets which are easily located. Upon that,there are 3 MRT stations located within the radius of the suites. The nearest MRT station with 7min walk is the Nanjing San Min station which is easily allowed you to travel over to Shi Lin, Xi Men night markets and Long Shan temple. This MRT station is 1 stop away from Taipei Arena. (Taipei Xiao Ju Dan) _The Con to the suites is located at the main road near the huge cross junction. The shelter did not extend to the road side and upon alight from your transport, you might get soak in the heavy rain. Overall, brilliant and recommended.",
