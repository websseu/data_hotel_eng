Cold towel and juice on arrival, friendly staff and a bell not to carry your bags. Big room, lovely clean modern bathroom, balcony and free water tea and coffee. 2 swimming pools, one on the roof, free towels, pool side service,mini mart and beautiful restaurant, massive buffet breakfast and free wifi in all areas of the hotel. The staff are really friendly and helpful. On the east side so a short safe walk to the more busy bars and then 10 min walk to the west and sunset beach. Lots of places to eat cheaply and well near buy and lots of places to book tours, found last bar the best and cheapest prices for this. Love this hotel and can't recommend enough !! ",

    "detail": "Our stay was awesome! So much so that we went to Phi Phi for a few nights, then skipped Krabi town and came back here! The pool is a little small and crowded, the check in staff can be a little slow and the eggs lady at breakfast was pretty clueless but apart from that I totally loved it here. One thing their website doesn't say is that while it's in Krabi it's only accessible by boat. We drove, and had a hard time finding the office to park our car at but we found it in the end near the jetty. Our car was safe for a period of 5 nights and parking was free. The boat ride over was cheap, but pack light because lugging a suitcase from boat to boat wears thin! When you're at Realeigh Beach Krabi (the beach this hotel is on) make sure you walk around and check out the whole area - east and west side. Tip: get up early, the beach was deserted until about 8am (so too was the breakfast buffet). Meals in the restaurant were super tasty, much more expensive than other areas but generous serves and really tasty. The hotel has an activities centre that organises great day trips - make sure you pop in there to do a day trip. A day trip to all the islands was great fun - Chicken Island etc. The boat that the hotel organised was by far the best boat out on the water that day, so while it might be a tad more expensive it was worth it. We left our wallets, keys etc on the boat and they were well looked after by the staff. They also did a head count each time we got out to swim so safety was important to them - definitely recommend doing this through the hotel. Walking Street is right next door, although pretty small so don't expect much. I'll be skipping Krabi town next time I'm in the area and heading straight here. Best hotel in Krabi I think! ",

    "detail": "Hotel is in very good location. Good facilities. Friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was ok. If you want to book any activities go to the street agencies and bargain-do not use package offer-more expensive and less quality. For the best place to eat-look at Trip adviser. If you want to visit other islands-super convenient place; just 3 min walking distance from hotel to the ticket office to rent long-tail boat. Ao Nang beach is not the best beach in Krabi, so get the boat and go to Railay. 5 min from Ao Nang. Also tickets are cheap. From Railay you can get a kayak boat for a few hundreds (two people) and explore the rocks, caves, and go snorkelling where are less people. Small tip: get watermelon to attract some fishes!!;) Overal: very happy about location, hotel and activities in Krabi!! P.s. Do not stay in small islands - it's boating, unless you look for peace.",

    "detail": "Stayed in the pavilion suite for three days and found the location of the hotel to be heavenly. The place is very peaceful, soothing and relaxing. Its right on the beach and is the last hotel before the cliffs which makes teh location even more amazing. The hotel is a around a hundred meters from the main shopping area in ao nang. Basically, everything about the location was amazing. The pavilion suite i stayed in was very good too. The room was spacious and with all necessary amenities, clean bathroom and all. The thai thai restaurant with its sitting area next to the beach and the thai thai massage parlour again next to the beach were both as good as it gets. The quality of the food for lunch/dinner was one of the best i had in thailand. The tour service at the hotel lobby was very reasonable cost wise and the service was good too. Would use them again. The only downside about the hotel was the breakfast. I think it needs to improve alot. In short, a highly recommended hotel and one i would love to stay in again if I'm heading to Krabi/Aonang.",
