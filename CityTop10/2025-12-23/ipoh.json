    "detail": "My son and I both really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Weil. The breakfast buffet is one of the best we have ever tried. ALL the Staff are nice and helpful and service at every level and dept are ALL excellent. The room is very comfortable and also on the 10th floor room we had the view of Ipoh surroundings is very nice, and esp the surrounding limestone hills / mountains. Another big asset is the hotel is connected to the Ipoh Parade Mall which has many kinds of good restaurants. Note that the hotel and most others fill up on weekends -- evidently filled up because of local foodie tourists coming to Ipoh, even foodies from Singapore. Ipoh till now has its excellent food (reputation) basically everywhere. Ipoh main lacking though is ease of transport. Going out of the hotel is quite easy but not going back. So Weil Hotel location is a plus too since it is so central and many places are within walking distance. We got a local 3G data card for our tablet and used that to navigate the streets. All in all I think Weil is likely the best hotel in Ipoh now. Weil is setting the bar now for real value and excellent comfort. And then of course is the everywhere food in Ipoh -- a main everyday pursuit for excellent taste and tummy happy time !! ",

    "detail": "I was surprised at how centrally located the hotel was. Pub street was just behind, far enough so you don't hear the loud music from your room, but close enough to just take a 2 minute stroll to some of the best nightspots in town. It was also relatively near to a lot of the famous food shops. Two of the best dim sum in town are just a 4-minute walk away, perfect way to start your day. We took the triple room, and there was even a balcony. And the bathroom was so huge. Free drinking water too, just bring your own bottle down to the lobby to fill up. Also they had several reserved parking spots for guests at the back of the hotel, perfect if you are driving and do not want to pay for public parking by the roadside. I would really recommend this hotel, especially for other Malaysians making a short trip to Ipoh.",

    "detail": "This may be a smallish 3-star hotel (without a swimming pool, gym & other facilities normally associated with higher end hotels & resorts), but it is definitely new (established in 2011) and clean. My family and I made a recent trip to Ipoh and had a good 2 night-stay at MH. Pleasantly surprised. We got the Family Room for RM350 per nite (RM390 for weekends and peak). May not be the best in terms of value, but it was spacious enough with 1 Queen and 1 Single Beds. We added an extra bed to cater for a total of 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids). Service was good - efficient and friendly staff. Located next to McDs and many other eateries, 2-3 minutes drive to AEON (Jusco) mall and just next to the entrance into Ipoh from the PLUS Highway. So, for me, I consider this to be location friendly. I have not stayed in other hotels in Ipoh, but I would certainly consider MH on my next visit to Ipoh.",
