    "detail": "Thankyou to all the beautiful staff for a lovely stay. I made the booking not knowing much about the place as it had not yet opened. On arrival I was amazed at the beautiful hotel that we had chosen. Great location, friendly staff, amazing breakfast, beautiful facilities. Hotel was great even with young kids thanks to the kids club- which we didn’t actually use much as there was a kids play centre in the shopping centre next door that ended up being more convenient for where we were at the time. Also the swimming pool. Only recommendations would be to have some dishwashing liquid so we could do our own dishes, ie kids cups/drink bottles spoons etc. and heating for he pool- it was pretty chilly in there! Other thing to note was that the street noise is quite loud- fine if you sleep well, which luckily we do (in saying that though we were there for 4 nights over NYE, so was probably louder at bat time of year). Thankyou again, I hope we get come back and stay in the future. ",

Beachfront location on Yen Phu, a 15 miinute walk to Sailing club. Buffet breakfast is good. Rooms are new and quite well equipped. Price usually includes breakfast and internet. Best bang for buck 4-5 star hotel in Nha Trang from my experience.",

    "detail": "Vinpearl Resort delivers on the money. It is expensive, much more expensive than anything I've been to in Vietnam. However, the level of service is high. The staff cleans your room twice a day, there's rose petals on your bed, you get a free bottle of champagne when you get there, chocolate on your pillow...that sort of place. The water park is free and the most fun you will have there. There's also some amazing light shows, dolphin shows, animal shows. If you have been to Vietnam, you'll know what I mean when I say it's all Vietnamese style. Nothing is really polished like the West...but it's all uniquely fun in it's own, down to Earth way. I guess that's the best to describe a lot of attractions in Vietnam. Anyway, the buffet is top notch, but the funny thing is that the buffet in one hotel building may be a little better than in another. You can go to any building in a compound. So you have a waterpark, amusement park with rides, activities that range from light shows to Vietnamese musicians, swimming pools, and shuttles to take you everywhere. The only drawback is the price. IMHO, it's worth trying Vinpearl once in your life....but it's much more cost effective to stay at a hotel, or mini-hotel in Nha Trang and just go visit Vinpearl Land one day to use all the rides and fun stuff. I paid about 250$ a night and I thought that was too steep...but some people have that sort of money, so power to them. Oh, and for the record, this place is on an island next to Nha Trang. If you want to experience Nha Trang you travel on a cable car over the ocean and then go take a ride to the city. Ergo, if you want to see Nha Trang it's better to stay at a hotel in the city.",

    "detail": "Tôi biết tới tên Radission Blu vì ấn tượng tốt mà KS đã để lại sau một chuyến đi châu Âu. Lần này biết Radission Blu Cam Ranh vừa xây dựng đang vắng khách vì Covid. Chúng tôi đã bay tới Cam Ranh và ở đây từ 6-10/7/2020. Tôi đã từng ở nhiều khách sạn khu vực Cam Ranh. Nhưng đây là khách sạn tốt nhất so với các khách sạn 5* mà tôi từng ở. Mọi dịch vụ đều rất chuyên nghiệp. Ăn sáng rất tốt. Các món ăn đựơc chế biến tinh tế. Ăn tối ở nhà hàng sát bờ biển cũng khá ngon. Sạch sẽ, yên tĩnh, khác hẳn với Cam Ranh và Nha Trang đầy khách TQ ồn ào trước Covid! Giá phòng còn rất rẻ có lẽ do chưa có nhiều khách. Nếu bạn nào muốn nghỉ dưỡng, yên tĩnh, thưởng thức một buổi sáng vừa ăn sáng vừa nghỉ ngơi cho tới khi muốn trở lại phòng taa5i khu vực Cam Ranh, thì thời gian này chọn Radission Blu là rất thích hợp. We know the name of Radission Blu a couple years ago when we travel to Europe and stayed in a Radission Blu in Warsaw. We decided to stay in Radission Blu Cam Ranh because its name and the hotel has just been build in Cam Ranh Resort Area. We stayed here from 6-10 July 2020. We used to stay in many Cam Ranh area hotels. We can say this is the best hotel compared to the 5 * hotels that we've ever stayed in. All services are very professional. Breakfast was very good. Dinner at the beachfront restaurant is also quite delicious. The hotel is very clean, quiet, different from Cam Ranh and Nha Trang full of noisy Chinese guests before Covid! Room rates are still very good probably due to not many guests b/c Covid. If you want to fully enjoy your holiday, then it is best decision to choose Radission Blu Cam Ranh by this time.",

December 2013, I stayed in Intercontinental Ho Chi Minh and that is the reason for I choose Intercontinental in Nha Trang this summer. And this is a briliant choice ever in my vacation this summer. I have informed the hotel for my early arrival as my flight in Nha Trang at 8AM, and they have room ready for me at 10AM. A nice treatment. Booking information in Agoda is matched with every detail: high floor, extra bed, early checking ... Even my room has extra bed for my younger sister, it is still large for 3 of us. very peaceful view from my balcony, modern design in every detail room's decoration, bath room is beautiful and sexy on its ways. Facilities are incredible with speaker, LED tivi ... Only 2 not good things are wifi and bluetooth connection for the speaker, however the manager come to my room himself for apologise in late responding in wifi. It is nice. One of the best is swimming pool, it is modern decoration - large - jacuzzi inside, my family has great time there. Staffs are very helpfull everytime we need helps. Beach is large and has the security to guard you from the hotel to the beach (as we have cross the Tran Phu street) Believe me, it becomes the best 5 starts hotel nowadays in Nha Trang.",

    "detail": "This is the 4th time we stayed at Evason Ana Mandara Nha Trang. This time also we had a very comfortable and relux time at the upgraded suite room. We enjoyed doing nothing but taking a nap in front of the beach, drunk, reading books and swimming in the resort. This resort is close to the local restaurants in Nha Trang, so, we also went there to enjoy the local food. More than that, we were very glad to meet some staff again, such as Ms. Shiina, Ms. Van, Ms. Thu,,, and many. Next time when we return to Nha Trang, we will definitely choose Evason Ana Mandara Nha Trang to stay and looking forward to meeting the staff working there. ",
