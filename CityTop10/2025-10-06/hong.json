    "detail": "I would say it is the Best Price ever if you would like to have a short stay in Hong Kong only for some good sleeping time every night. The location is fantastic. You can walk to Centre. The variety and food around the hotel are good and value for money. Hong Kong is small! You can not expect to have a large room like when you are doing a budget traveling in United States of America. Definitely worth it even though the space is small but, it is the best price ever in Hong Kong in a 4-star hotel. Good customer service! Excellent! ",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governorâ€™s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! Itâ€™s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And itâ€™s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

    "name": "The Mira Hong Kong",
    "detail": "Hong Kong is a mere 1 hour and 40 minutes flight away from Manila so it is a frequent destination for me and my family. We visit this vibrant city at least once a year and love going the week after Christmas. My first time to Hong Kong was when I was a 7 year-old kid and this was known back then as the Miramar. In recent years we used to stay in another hotel in Kowloon, but for the past 5 years we have been making The Mira more of our family choice the past 5 years. Every year we come back there is always something new added. It is super clean, modern and ultra chic, the bathrooms with glass walls, wi-fi everywhere...Beds are very comfortable. This is very important because in Hong Kong you have to walk a lot. (Choosing your hotel based on it being just to sleep for the night does not really apply to Hong Kong) I like the convenience of having a cell phone in each room, which allows the guest to make room to room calls; communicate with each other for free (perfect for families) while going around the city, and is an easy way to for people to contact you...certainly very convenient as we usually go our separate ways with my teenage daughters around; a money saver tool ; no need to depend on your mobile phone on international roaming! The Mira is across Knustford Terrace on Kimberley Road which has a Ben & Jerry's Ice cream on the ground floor, and an array of restaurants, and cozy bars, steak houses, restos serving Spanish tapas, Italian food,Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese restos; it's a great alternative for those who find the area of Lan Kwai Fong in Central too far , should you want a little night life. This place gets packed , yet this is what adds to Knutsford Terrace's charm. It is not in a typical building, and most of the bars /restos give the clients a choice of either staying in an open air area or inside. Really charming and picturesque at night!!",

    "name": "Mini Central",
    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",
