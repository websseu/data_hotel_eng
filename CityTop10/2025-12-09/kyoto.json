After our welcome drink (which was amazing!!) we got few information about the hotel and we have been really pleased discovering the Onsen was a free in house guest facility The Onsen was great we put on our super comfy kimono and enjoyed the hot water tub. Staff was great and really helpful, they even helped us book a great traditional dinner in a restaurant. We didn't really want to leave! I highly recommend this hotel in Kyoto ",

The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat.

Best located (for my purpose) hotel for me and my small family. There is a kimono rental shop just at the entrance and the selection was small but very beautiful. I personally did not rent from there but from what I can observed, it is a convenient place to start for your kimono experience. They charged around 3900 yen when I was there.

There is washing machine, hotel is clean and new condition. There are 7-11 and Lawson close by. The place is close to Kyoto tower and Isetan and Kyoto station. Totally is ok for spending money here.",
