    "detail": "We spent 3 nights in a tiny room in this hotel (although most rooms in 2 and 3-star hotels in Paris are on the rather small side). To our delight, we had a small balcony with a side view of the beautiful dome of Les Invalides. Although the hotel does not appear to be very modern, it thankfully has an elevator and the rooms have flat-screen tvs. Whenever you leave the hotel, the key must be surrendered at the reception. Location-wise, the nearest metro (Ecole Militaire) is only a few minutes away by foot and many good cafés and bistros dot the area. We appreciated the free wifi, the kind staff and the breakfast consisting of toast, different spreads, yoghurt, fruit, cheeses, cold cuts, and eggs, but the eggs had to be prepared yourself, either boiled or fried in the pan provided.

    "name": "St Christopher's Inn Paris - Gare du Nord",
    "detail": "I arrived at Gare du Nord train station, Paris from the CDG airport (easy - phew!) and found that St Christopher's Inn was easy to find once you navigated yourself out of the station and found your bearings on Rue de Dunkurque (walk towards the post office). Although I arrived early they were very friendly and offered me a shower to freshen up and (paid) lockers to hold my stuff until 2pm check in. If you forget anything like a towel (whoops!), you can rent one for the length of your stay as well as buy other basic essentials. I found the staff very informative, spoke English well and tried their best to accommodate my every need. The room (6 mixed dorm) and bed linen were really clean (amazing doona!), warm and secure. You also got a massive drawer to lock your stuff in under your bunk. The showers were good but the cleaning agent/or disinfectant in the showers/communal bathroom was pretty stinky?! I also found it difficult to keep pressing the shower button whilst having a shower due to a neurological disorder in my arm but I managed. They were of a decent size so you could get changed in the cubicle without getting your clothes wet. The food at night was good (I'm a vegetarian - burger pattie was really dry) but not fantastic. The continental breakfast was on the other hand great and good quality! Baguettes, cheese, cereal, coffee, juice, etc. nice. I also used the laundry facilities up stairs (about 5 Euro wash and dry), which was good. Overall my stay there was great and will stay there again en route back to Oz. Can't really fault anything of locker, towel rent and laundry costs as well as stinky bathrooms but otherwise the location is pretty darn awesome! Thanks guys and gals. Looking forward to seeing you all again!! Oh and the free day tour with Roberta through Paris is so worth it!! Just rug up and don't drink too much coffee beforehand (no toilets!! ha!).",

The lobby area was really small with just one chair and the hotel was undergoing some renovation works but we not really bothered with the noise as we were out most of the times. We were very happy with the location of the hotel where it is conveniently situated near the train station, never ending stretch of food places and above all, we love the newly renovated hotel rooms - it was modernly designed and looks oh-so-new! However, it would have been great if there was proper breakfast served. The breakfast included was 2 packets of madeleine (cake and a can of orange juice (minute maid). On some days, we had to request for the madeleine and orange juice to be topped up after our room was made up. (Perhaps the staff had forgotten to do so). The staff were friendly and accommodating, especially Alexander and Christopher. I think the hotel is value for money and definitely would be awesome once the renovation is done for the lobby. We would definitely recommend our family and friends to consider Hotel Libertel Gare de l'Est Francais for their visit in Paris.",

    "detail": "When I was booking online our Triple room for 5 nights in this Hotel I asked in advance for the top floor and a non-smoking room. After our flight to Paris we were tired, so after we received keys to our room #535 we tried to menage our stuff quickly (with kids there are a lot of stuff), inspite the elevator was small, I've done our bags fast enough. In addition staff suggested to leave our stroller near the bar, that was very convenient. After we entered the room and opened our window we were killed by the view on Opera and Paris, as well as we had a balcony across all of our windows on the highest floor of the hotel. As for room it was normal Paris-size room, not the brand new, but tidy and convenient with the safe deposit and the mini-bar, which I used as a fridge. The location of the hotel is one of the best for tourist on the quite street with Italian restaurant and the glossary store on the ground floor. It took us only 1 minute to get to Galeries and the metro.",
