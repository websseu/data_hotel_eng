    "detail": "One of my favorite hotels in Bangkok, if not, in all of Thailand. Let's consider the price first. Chances are, on most nights, you can get a high floor room here. Considering the location (Siam shopping/nightlife), and... that this is an authentic 5 star, you just won't go wrong. The only minor setback: just one restaurant in this entire (massive) hotel. But the fact the restaurant has amazing staff (I've stayed here many times- they always remember me, even by my nickname)... and the food is truly classy, I'm ok with it. The hotel itself, is elegant, classy... room decor is a perfect mix of modern/chic style, with a hint of bohemian/classic. Very nicely designed rooms, that make it a true 5 star. I'm a fitness buff... so I can't stand hotels that delegate a small room in a basement somewhere, put two treadmills, and a workout ball in the middle, and then say fitness center included... this hotel, has a real gym- with real machines- even a smith machine (bench press, shoulder press, etc) with sufficient 20 kg plates around for a serious workout. Full credits to the hotel for this point. It's a big enough gym and very modern too, to feel like you're in a real gym and be motivated. The spa (included, in the rooms) is nice too- with a great steam room, hot tub, and, sauna. Love staying here... a great workout... then relax in the steam room, and then get some amazing food at their restauarant. Seriously, for this price- you'll have a hard time finding better in this area. I know, for I've tried many others in the area, and always end up coming back here.",

Again, the staff was superb and worked so nice. I've stayed in most high end hotels in Bangkok and would say this one is mediocre in comparison; not good nor bad. The staff are the best part. Room service food could be improved, but it was really cheap so I can't complain. The view from the high floors is quite nice so that was a positive as well. ",

The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

    "detail": "I am a visitor from Hong Kong and stay at Pullman Hotel G. Yesterday was my first day to check in to the hotel, Unfortunately I found my luggage was wrongly pick up at the airport. I was feeling lost and don't know what to do at that moment cause me and my girl friend doesn't speak Thai-language, also I don't even have a contact of my airline. So I went back to the lobby and looking for HELP. One of your staff which stay at Bell Captain side call Ping heard my situation and started help me to found out the number of the airline and talk with them about my issue. After all the conversation done, Ping suggest me to take the wrong luggage back to airport first and let BFS to handle my case. While we sent back the luggage and go to travel around, it was mid-night when we back to hotel. Another Bell Captain JoJo was there and I was asked for help to tracking my case. It was 8 hours later since I sent back the luggage and seems no luck on it as JoJo mention after he help to call the BFS. JoJo said he will stay connect with the BFS and let me know any update if need. Finally, BFS call me one hour later and said mine luggage was back to the airport and will sent back to the hotel I live! The next day I go back to Bell Captain, NJ saw my letter which provide by the hotel and already know what am I think of. My luggage is back! It's really amazing on all of you guys which help me on this ultimate-scared case and I think the training and the empathy of your staff are very well. I will recommend all my friend who will be BangKoK to travel to come to Pullman Bangkok Hotel G ! Also, a concierge staff call OFF also help us to contact the Van we book cause the time on my booking time is complicated. Thanks for his help too. Finally, i was received a cheat call from bangkok, thanks for your staff GAM to help me translate and let them know we are not worth to cheat. Again, thank you so much for all of your staff which helps. ",

    "name": "Boss Suites Nana",
    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",
