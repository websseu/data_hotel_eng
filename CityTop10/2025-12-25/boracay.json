    "detail": "Great beachfront location close to D’mall. Sky pool bar is a huge attraction and definitely is this hotels USP. Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",

Most of the hotels have a beach frontage which is a must when selecting a property in Boracay. The hotel has a wonderful restaurant on the beach front which is were you have your breakfast. Breakfasts cater more for the Chinese and Korean palate rather than westerners but lunch and dinners are great, especially the lunch buffet ($US12-13) which includes unlimited beers at that price. It has two pool areas and you can always find a banana chair most times of the day. From the hotel you come out on the beach side and walk along the sand to a really good selection of bars and restaurants where you can find dining options ranging from $10/person to as expensive as $50/person. You can get even cheaper in the traditional Philippino restaurants if your game LOL. ",

Til our next stay ;) ",
