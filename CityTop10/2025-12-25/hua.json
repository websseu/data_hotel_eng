In the room, there were lots of plugs for charging devices, plus robes & slippers, and the wifi was fast. The bed was comfortable and the room was spotless. The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

    "detail": "We found Hisea Hua Hin Hotel by chance when we we're talking to a local across the street from the hotel. We told her that we're searching for another hotel to stay at for the remaining 3 more weeks of vacation in Hua Hin. She immediately pointed to Hisea Hua Hin Hotel across the street which according to her, just barely opened for business. We decided to check it out right there and then, and we were lucky to meet the owner himself who showed us around. Hisea Hua Hin Hotel is definitely a jewel of a find, for its highly detailed facilities, tasteful decor, furnishings, amenities, friendly and helpful staffs, and for the price! Additionally, the location is perfect and within walking distance to a lot of Hua Hin's city center places of interest, and the beautiful Hua Hin beach! We've looked at many hotels in the area prior to visiting Hisea Hua Hin Hotel and nothing beats Hisea Hua Hin Hotel for what it offers, the price, location, and the staff. Being that it's brand new, it's absolutely immaculate! Although it's low season and therefore it's not fully booked, I see housekeeping clean every rooms everyday! The beds are the most comfortable we've ever found during our 3 months of travel in Asia, and the owner accommodates our needs to the best that he can. Case in point, I wanted an electric fan in my room due to my special need for it, and he happily obliged without question although the A/C in his hotel works perfectly. The staff are very attentive and helpful, and the owner is a hands on kind of a businessman. He's always around and can easily be reached and easy to talk to. Now, this is not the Hilton or Centara, but it doesn't have the high price of those 2 either and for all the quality service and amenities Hisea Hua Hin offers, it just can't be beat! Lastly, I would like to add that I have worked for big 5 star hotels in Las Vegas as a V.I.P. Associate for 5 years, therefore, I know a jewel of a find when I see one when it comes to hotels, amenities,",

Staff very friendly, had to move room as extended stay due to enjoying time in Hua Hin and cleaner helped me move even taking out if drawer in 1 room and putting in same drawer in next room. Saved packing and unpacking into suitcase. Pool was nice, shame area around not so big and had to keep moving sun lounger to follow sun! But everything else made up for it! Definitely stay again!",

There are also few (quiet) bars/restaurants 5mins walk away if you want to eat somewhere else. Location is inbetween cha am and hua hin so can't walk to town, but taxi available for 200/300bht.",

    "detail": "Great convient hotel in Hua Hin. Rooms are small, but they are clean and modern and the beds are the most comfortable ones I've slept in. We chose this hotel because it was next to a friends condo. Access to the beach is good and there is a great night market 400 m from the hotel. Best thing was that we were upgraded to a family room, so a little more space and bunk beds for our little guy which he made into an extra playing area. The pool isn't the greatest, but good enough to get wet. Will definitely stay here again. ",
