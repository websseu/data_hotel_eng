    "detail": "a small, cosy, newly renovated hotel near luxembourg metro station. free wifi which is not very common in hotels in europe. this is definitely a big plus point. shops and restaurants are all around the hotel. a nice chinese restaurant just next door. if you have a lot of carry on the day of departure, hotel offer airport shuttle bus service @ euro 18/pax. very convenient. pro : free wifi, great location, clean and cozy, friendly and helpful staff. con : small shower area but it is ok for an average size. no toileteries provided. not a family hotel. good for solo or couple travellers. overall, this is a great hotel and value for money. i will definitely stay here again when i come to paris again.

    "detail": "Love this staff, all rockstars. Helpful and super friendly. This was my general experience in France, but it was even more so at this hotel. The room was small, like most hotels, and besides the very stylish decor (which I love), the layout was so good that it felt twice as large as it looked. Meaning we were easily able to get stuff out of our way and relax. Great bathroom and amenities. Super good looking lobby and stairs. Also, it smells great there. They have a branded set of scents and they where very pleasing. (Of course that’s a matter of taste) Great coffee shops, Monop, and IKEA near by so some cheap necessities. Overall I was very happy with every aspect of the stay. I didn’t have breakfast, but it looked like it would be good. Even the 2 star hotels had the best croissants. ",

The staff was so helpful to help me to find my way (particularly the lady in the morning who actually drew a map for me). However, all was ruined when I left at 4am to catch a flight and the desk clerk (who I had to wake up) held up my taxi claiming I owed 60 euros in city tax when my Agoda paperwork said I had paid it. He threatened to call the police and keep me from my flight if I didn't pay him. I went back into the hotel with my credit card and he only charged it for 6 euros. I believe he was trying to get cash from me and when it didn't work he made a small charge. Its a shame that he ruined what was as great stay.",

To our delight, we had a small balcony with a side view of the beautiful dome of Les Invalides. Although the hotel does not appear to be very modern, it thankfully has an elevator and the rooms have flat-screen tvs. Whenever you leave the hotel, the key must be surrendered at the reception. Location-wise, the nearest metro (Ecole Militaire) is only a few minutes away by foot and many good cafés and bistros dot the area. We appreciated the free wifi, the kind staff and the breakfast consisting of toast, different spreads, yoghurt, fruit, cheeses, cold cuts, and eggs, but the eggs had to be prepared yourself, either boiled or fried in the pan provided.

    "detail": "I arrived at Gare du Nord train station, Paris from the CDG airport (easy - phew!) and found that St Christopher's Inn was easy to find once you navigated yourself out of the station and found your bearings on Rue de Dunkurque (walk towards the post office). Although I arrived early they were very friendly and offered me a shower to freshen up and (paid) lockers to hold my stuff until 2pm check in. If you forget anything like a towel (whoops!), you can rent one for the length of your stay as well as buy other basic essentials. I found the staff very informative, spoke English well and tried their best to accommodate my every need. The room (6 mixed dorm) and bed linen were really clean (amazing doona!), warm and secure. You also got a massive drawer to lock your stuff in under your bunk. The showers were good but the cleaning agent/or disinfectant in the showers/communal bathroom was pretty stinky?! I also found it difficult to keep pressing the shower button whilst having a shower due to a neurological disorder in my arm but I managed. They were of a decent size so you could get changed in the cubicle without getting your clothes wet. The food at night was good (I'm a vegetarian - burger pattie was really dry) but not fantastic. The continental breakfast was on the other hand great and good quality! Baguettes, cheese, cereal, coffee, juice, etc. nice. I also used the laundry facilities up stairs (about 5 Euro wash and dry), which was good. Overall my stay there was great and will stay there again en route back to Oz. Can't really fault anything of locker, towel rent and laundry costs as well as stinky bathrooms but otherwise the location is pretty darn awesome! Thanks guys and gals. Looking forward to seeing you all again!! Oh and the free day tour with Roberta through Paris is so worth it!! Just rug up and don't drink too much coffee beforehand (no toilets!! ha!).",

    "detail": "The staff was really kind and the front desk manager was very friendly. Tough walk up the stairs (narrow and winding) if you have bigger bags, so request lower floor rooms. Breakfast was good and the location was excellent. Really great to access the metro or just walk to some sites. less than 20 minutes to Cité/Notre Dame. Easy access from CDG, to Orly, and Eiffel Tower side of town. Room was small, older building with no air conditioning in our room, but good air flow from the courtyard. Room was a little aged and cramped but overall pretty clean and housekeeping came each day with clean sheets and towels.",
