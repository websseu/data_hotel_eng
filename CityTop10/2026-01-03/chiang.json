    "name": "Kokotel Chiang Mai Nimman",
    "detail": "1. Comparing with the other hotels in Chiang Mai, Kokotel's price is very cheap. 2. The location is far away from the Old Town (4km which is not able to walk under the hot weather). You always need to take the tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Old Town. The hotel is near the Nimman District and you are able to take a walk about 10 minutes to the Nimman District. The location of the hotel is difficult to describe, most of the drivers did not realize the exact location. It would be better to ask the Road Number in Thailand Language in order to tell the tuk-tuk / songthaew drivers. 3. Room is clean and the toilet is also clean. 4. Staff is nice and helpful. They will provide the tourist information for you such as the Saturday/ Sunday night market. 5. Providing a breadfast starting from 07:00AM to 10:00AM. Helping us to call the airport taxi service at mid-night. Although the taxi service is not provided by the hotel, the taxi driver is also polite and helping us to take the luggage.",

The staff speaks very good english and are always providing advice on where to go, and how much the fares should be. When we bought some apples from the open air market and tried to borrow a bread knife from the kitchen at De Chai, the staff offered to slice them up for us. 15 minutes later, the staff came to our room with a beautiful place of nicely sliced apples. This is what differentiate De Chai the Deco hotel from all the other Chiang Mai hotels we have previously stayed in. The attention to the little details. ",

    "detail": "Chiang Mai can get real expensive during the high season, but this hotel is one of the rare finds when you're not looking to bunk with strangers in a hostel. Located a bit outside the city center, you can definitely find all you need for a good night sleep. The staffs are super friendly, rooms are clean, and the location is peaceful and quiet. There were a few flaws to my stay: the room phone we're wired when we arrived, the bathroom smelled a bit funky, the door lock wasn't working, and the shower was a bit broken, but the staffs handled them very swift and professionally and we were all good by the second day of the stay. It might not be as convenient to get here if you don't have a mode of personal transportation (rented car or bike), but if you do, there's plenty of roofed parking available with 24 hours security. Overall it was a pleasant experience, would come by again if I ever need another budget stay in Chiang Mai. ",

    "detail": "This is the 2nd time I’ve stayed here. The 1st time was 5 years ago and I loved the place. This 2nd time didn’t disappoint. Lovely room, good food and an army of friendly staff. The breakfast buffet has much variety, catering for all tastes and there are many staff on watch to top up your coffee. The Lobby tourist information desk is helpful. It is 10 minutes’ walk to the Night Markets however, they have become overpriced with limited variety of goods. However, this is the best location nearby for a wide range of mid to higher priced cafes, restaurants and bars. Without these markets (starting at 6 pm) the nearby eating, drinking and shopping options are limited. Chiang Mai is a large city where tourist attractions are spaced a long way apart. There is not really a central Chiang Mai location for a hotel. There are plenty of transport options from the Empress. The airport is some 20 minutes’ drive away, costing around 160 THB by taxi. Chiang Mai has a very broad variety of attractions and a range of organised tours are available. Such tours usually include visits to wildlife and adventure activities plus jewellery and craft stores. The craft and artistry in Chiang Mai are amazing and worth seeing but can be expensive to buy. The taxi driver from the airport gave his business card, offering pre-arranged tours or a full daytime charter costing 2000 THB where you chose where you go or not go. I chose to focus on the religious, cultural and historical attractions. Visiting only these attractions took 2 full days and the driver visited many wonderful modern and ancient places. Before, I did not know that Chiang Mai had such a rich ancient history, ruins and similar attractions. These are not that well promoted as wildlife, adventure and crafts seem to have the best publicity. Sadly the Chiang Mai Zoo, which was amazing before, has gone down badly and is obviously struggling. The big drought in Thailand is not helping matters. After the disappointment of the Chiang Mai",

    "detail": "In July 2011 I went to Thailand with my family, 2 adults & 2 children (5 & 12 years old. For our 6 day stay In Chiang Mai we chose the Raming Lodge based on the very positive reviews on Agoda. The positive rating of this hotel turned out to be well deserved & the hotel was even better than expected. The Raming lodge was one of the best hotels of our Thailand trip. We got connecting rooms which are very practical for families (but quite difficult to find in Thailand). Rooms were really charming: nicely decorated, spacious, well equipped (air-conditioning, fridge, wardrobes,…)& clean. There was also a swimming pool at the hotel, which was highly appreciated by our children. Breakfast (included in the roomrate) was good & varied. There was a good choice of western & Asian food. The restaurant of the hotel also served good food at lunch. Note that there are several other restaurants in the street, so you don’t need to go very far to have a meal if you prefer to eat outside the hotel. Staff was very kind, helpful & smiling. It is clear that the Raming Lodge does everything to please the guests. We booked a 2 day/1 night trek at the travel agency of the hotel. The trek was of high quality & well organized. It was not more expensive than in other travel agencies. As we booked the trek at the hotel we got vouchers for a free foot massage at the spa of the hotel. The massage was really relaxing & performed by specialists. The Raming Lodge is very well located, just in between the Night Bazar & the old city of Chiang Mai. Everything is at walking distance. As mentioned in some other reviews, there are some go-go bars in the street nearby the hotel but this was not at all disturbing. Street was safe. We strongly recommend this hotel for those who are looking for a charming well located hotel in Chiang Mai. This hotel is also perfect for families & those who want to take some rest & take benefit of a spa.",
