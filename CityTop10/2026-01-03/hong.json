    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

    "detail": "My wife and I lived in Hong Kong twice, for a total of four years. For most of that time we lived at mid-level on the Victoria side, and we loved the view we had, day and night. There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

It is close to the metro station and the buses to and from the airport and the rest of Hong Kong so it's easily accessible. Taxis weren't too expensive either. At first, it may be a bit difficult to find because it is not very clearly marked, but just look at the numbers on the doors to help! The rooms were clean and tidy (and I shared with all boys so can only get better) and I was pleasantly surprised at how comfy the beds were! There are lockers in the room that were safe and plenty of communal areas to relax in. There were some useful facilities; computers, wifi and towels to rent. There are lots of fun, friendly people here. The staff were super helpful and also held lots of events for anyone that wanted to take part...and I made so brilliant friends which was great as I was traveling alone! I had the best time here and will definitely be staying here again!!!",

The size of the beds were standard deluxe unlike other hotels in Hong Kong which has tiny single beds. Our only complaint would be the shower which is small and lacks privacy. Other than that, everything else is perfect. Location is very good too. Would definitely stay here again. ",

    "detail": "Fifth hotel I stayed in Hong Kong. User friendly hotel, i.e., easy to understand what to do, where to go, how to get there. All high priced, upscale hotels hand you a map that you need a microscope from NASA to see, and circle the directions. This hotel has taken the initiative to enlarge the microscopic subway map, to further assist their guests. I paid double the price for the other hotels and got the same size room and no customer service from the overstaffed front desk staff. All housekeepers were exceptional in each hotel. However, in addition to the EXCEPTIONAL customer service at this hotel, there is even a rooftop swimming pool to entertain the kids, as well as a spectacular view. Though it may be described by some as older and maybe could be updated, don't be discouraged. And , yep, the rooms are small. . . but it's Hong Kong. And for the value this hotel offers, you can rent two or three rooms for your family for less than one at a 5-star rated. ",
