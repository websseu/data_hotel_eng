    "detail": "I have stayed at many hotels in Chiang Mai on business trips. This one was by far the best in the downtown area near the Night Bazaar. For me, location is very important in Chiang Mai. This is the best hotel in the location if you want luxury at a good value. The food here was very good also. This was our first time taking young children with us to Chiang Mai. The staff were very friendly and helpful with the children who were ages 1 and 3. We will definitely come back to the Centara. We love Chiang Mai.",

    "detail": "1. Comparing with the other hotels in Chiang Mai, Kokotel's price is very cheap. 2. The location is far away from the Old Town (4km which is not able to walk under the hot weather). You always need to take the tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Old Town. The hotel is near the Nimman District and you are able to take a walk about 10 minutes to the Nimman District. The location of the hotel is difficult to describe, most of the drivers did not realize the exact location. It would be better to ask the Road Number in Thailand Language in order to tell the tuk-tuk / songthaew drivers. 3. Room is clean and the toilet is also clean. 4. Staff is nice and helpful. They will provide the tourist information for you such as the Saturday/ Sunday night market. 5. Providing a breadfast starting from 07:00AM to 10:00AM. Helping us to call the airport taxi service at mid-night. Although the taxi service is not provided by the hotel, the taxi driver is also polite and helping us to take the luggage.",

    "detail": "Chiang Mai can get real expensive during the high season, but this hotel is one of the rare finds when you're not looking to bunk with strangers in a hostel. Located a bit outside the city center, you can definitely find all you need for a good night sleep. The staffs are super friendly, rooms are clean, and the location is peaceful and quiet. There were a few flaws to my stay: the room phone we're wired when we arrived, the bathroom smelled a bit funky, the door lock wasn't working, and the shower was a bit broken, but the staffs handled them very swift and professionally and we were all good by the second day of the stay. It might not be as convenient to get here if you don't have a mode of personal transportation (rented car or bike), but if you do, there's plenty of roofed parking available with 24 hours security. Overall it was a pleasant experience, would come by again if I ever need another budget stay in Chiang Mai. ",

    "detail": "In July 2011 I went to Thailand with my family, 2 adults & 2 children (5 & 12 years old. For our 6 day stay In Chiang Mai we chose the Raming Lodge based on the very positive reviews on Agoda. The positive rating of this hotel turned out to be well deserved & the hotel was even better than expected. The Raming lodge was one of the best hotels of our Thailand trip. We got connecting rooms which are very practical for families (but quite difficult to find in Thailand). Rooms were really charming: nicely decorated, spacious, well equipped (air-conditioning, fridge, wardrobes,…)& clean. There was also a swimming pool at the hotel, which was highly appreciated by our children. Breakfast (included in the roomrate) was good & varied. There was a good choice of western & Asian food. The restaurant of the hotel also served good food at lunch. Note that there are several other restaurants in the street, so you don’t need to go very far to have a meal if you prefer to eat outside the hotel. Staff was very kind, helpful & smiling. It is clear that the Raming Lodge does everything to please the guests. We booked a 2 day/1 night trek at the travel agency of the hotel. The trek was of high quality & well organized. It was not more expensive than in other travel agencies. As we booked the trek at the hotel we got vouchers for a free foot massage at the spa of the hotel. The massage was really relaxing & performed by specialists. The Raming Lodge is very well located, just in between the Night Bazar & the old city of Chiang Mai. Everything is at walking distance. As mentioned in some other reviews, there are some go-go bars in the street nearby the hotel but this was not at all disturbing. Street was safe. We strongly recommend this hotel for those who are looking for a charming well located hotel in Chiang Mai. This hotel is also perfect for families & those who want to take some rest & take benefit of a spa.",

    "detail": "I stayed in a dorm under the roof. The dorm has 2 AC and a washbin. Outside the dorm is the shared toilet and bathroom. The locker for the luggage are to small to put a back pack inside. It's just for your valuables. Everything was very clean. You get a blanket and a pillow but no towel. At the terrace you have a wunderful view over Chiang Mai. Nearby is the somphet market and many temples. It's no problem to find breakfast in the surrounding. ",
