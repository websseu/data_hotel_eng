    "detail": "This was my third trip to Bali since first visiting in 1977.I've stayed in quite a few hotels in Bali and would recommend this establishment very highly.Certainly it is a quieter and nicer venue than most (in this price range)in the Kuta area.We preferred to stay a little further out from the bustle and noise of Kuta.It has great grounds and a good quality/size pool. The hotel's shuttle will take you to Kuta but you must make your own way back.A metered taxi costs an average of 50,000 rupiah, (and about US$5 doesn't break the bank). I would recommend it and stay there again.Great shopping can be had between Kuta and the hotel. Nearby resturants are cheap an well worthy of a visit.",

Outside the door is several massage shops and cafes, as well as the usual tailors and t-shirt shops. Kuta itself is about 3-4km if you want more shops, however why walk in the heat when the taxi costs about 5000RP. The hotel service is superior, and the complementary daily cocktail well received. The pool is well positioned in the centre of the hotel, and is in the shade after about 3pm (important if you want to avoid the sun) - although the pool hours are to 6pm, after which you can still swim, however the towel service shuts. The Premier suite was great for our 5yo as the bedroom is divided from the lounge. This is one hotel we will definately return to.",

Go to the beach and eat at La Playa, the best resto! Was also near a supermarket. Best value for money. Make sure you book it on sale without breakfast, just have breakfast outside, way better. Starbucks is also 2km away, you can ride grab. This hotel still deserves the 8/10 rating. ",

The room is quite spacious for Bali hotels’ standards with given price and quite clean. It has a large swimming pool. The staffs are polite, and they follow up my complaint about the not-so-cold AC after their engineer checked my room’s AC. Breakfast was standard, more choices than budget hotels for sure, but not that lavish. The restaurant has indoor seating for non-smoking tables and outdoor seating quite a distance for smoking tables, which is nice for non-smokers. Great overall experience and will definitely look forward to staying here in the future.",

    "detail": "I have tried two other famous 4 star hotels in Bali and i can say with full confidence that this hotel deserves to have a 5th star! Very clean rooms, towels, linens etc. Spotless. Very helpful and excited staff. Place feels luxurious. Super delicious with variety breakfast and room service. I complained about a neighbor being noisy and they did their best to control the situation and also offered me to sleep in a another room for the night. The next day, I found a hand written letter on my bed from the manager expressing his apologies, which really made me appreciate the customer service they have. ",
