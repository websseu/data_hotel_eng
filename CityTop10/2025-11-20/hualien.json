    "detail": "1) Very cheap 2) Walking distance to the inter-state train / bus station which is essential if you'd like to spend most of your time doing outdoor activities. Hualien's attractions are sporadic - so it is a lot more efficient to stay nearby the inter-state station than trying to find a place nearby some of the attractions. Plus, most of the main attractions are outside Hualien and you will need to take the bus to get around. 3) Very clean 4) The staffs were very hospitable, excited and cheerful. I was very impressed with their customer service. I left a metal ear pick in my hotel room after I left which I could not care less, and the staffs called and even sent me an e-mail stating that they were more than happy to post it! A bit extra but hey, for a small hotel in a small town, this hotel has better customer service than some of the 4-5 star hotel I had been to. 5) You can hire bicycles for free! As mentioned earlier, Hualien 's attractions are sporadic - riding a bicycles would make your trip a lot more fun! I personally feel like a stay in Hualien is incomplete without riding a bicycle around the town - plus it is free!",

The room was spacious and had very good facilities. The traditional Taiwanese breakfast of rice and dishes is sumptuous and delicious, a good meal to start the travel of the day. The location of the hotel is very convenient, just next to the railway station; simply walk straight after exiting, turn right after seeing the first seven-eleven shop. And the main bus station to take the city bus and the one day tourist bus to Taroko Gorge and Qixitan is just next to the train station.",

Very helpful pick up shuttle service which makes things much easier. Really thankful for one of the staff (didn't get his name) because he patiently waited for us to reach the train station (twice) cos of miscommunication about my arrival time at the Hualien train station. There is almost no space for opening the luggage on the floor. And shower is directly in front of the main toilet door, so have to be aware when bathing or the water will flow out onto the bedroom floor. Only four hooks or so for hanging. Breakfast wasn't too bad.",

However, please take note the check in time is 3pm. I was there at 2:30pm and there were no person to attend to me. I could not even enter the premise. Perhaps that is something the management can look into. Even we cannot go into the room, at least there is a reception to allow us to leave our luggages etc.",

They would drop whatever they are going just to greet you aloud, like Japanese style. Close to dining options too though bit far to night market. But no fault of theirs. 1st hotel we come across that serves supper and its so sumptious with noodles, porridge etc which can be considered as late dinner. Lots of variety for buffet breakfast too. You will be spoilt for choice. They tried to arrange a Taroka Gorge day trip for us. But travel agency advised not to go there as they are falling rocks and stones. Instead we spend time in Hualien city instead. We book a business double but they upgraded us free to a quad room with 2 queen beds equipped with a bath tub. 2 thumbs up to them. Only issue is sound proofing can be better. You can literally hear conversations when people talk and pass by the corridor outside. ",

    "detail": "The hotel is in a great place, you can go anywhere from there, near the station (3 minutes walk) and the car hiring company (1 minutes walk). The staff there is so so nice that I find no words to speak ill of them. Even though 1 of the receptionist's english was not good, she tried to explain and answer me all of what I am curious. There was one staff in the afternoon, when being asked about the transportation to some tourist spots, she helped find the best route for me, gave me the best advice how to go there in the most careful way. The food in the hotel is so delicious and not similar to all other places I have ever stayed in Taiwan. The facilities were in great facilities that I want to stay there longer and made Hualien the most most wonderful places in Taiwan for my trip.",
