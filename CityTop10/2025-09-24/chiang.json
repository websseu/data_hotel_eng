Despite a very frustrating experience with the car rental company,(through the hotel) , she was very understanding , patient & helpful in lending us support when we had to talk to the car rental company. She stepped in to resolve the issue so we could enjoy the rest of our holiday. We are very grateful for her intervention and assistance.

    "detail": "I had a fantastic stay at the 99 The Gallery Hotel in the Old City Chiang Mai. The staff were very helpful and warm, offered countless suggestions on how to spend my time in Chiang Mai and also helped to arrange a car rental. The room was spacious and clean, and the hotel was overall, very charming - decorated well. The breakfast was probably the highlight for the price-range compared to other hotels I have stayed at. I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Chiang Mai. ",
