The rooms are great, the pool is fantastic, breakfast and room service is good, the staff are nice and helpful, and it’s location next to the beach is nice. The resort is at least a year or two from being prime (if it does ever become a fully realized resort, it will almost feel like a Vegas resort hotel).. The long hallway has many shop stalls waiting to be occupied. The outside areas are still waiting for shops, also. A couple of restaurants have set up shop, but weren’t open. It does not have a gym or spa ready yet. A cinema is apparently being built. If you’re not planning on being in the hotel much, then this won’t be a big deal. Hoi An Old Town is only a 10 minute drive away, which is what people are going to Hoi An to see anyway.. I’m curious to see what the place becomes in the next year or so. I would stay there again.",

    "name": "Lasenta Boutique Hotel Hoian",
    "detail": "Our stay in Hoi An was overall an excellent experience. Lasenta itself is a very new hotel (3 months from what the concierge told us) and it definitely shows. Upon arriving, we were given a cold towel and a cool herbal drink and then were given the run down of information before being taken to our room. The concierge were always attending to our needs whether it's calling for a taxi or helping with our luggage or just greeting in the mornings. Our room (Grand Deluxe) was plenty spacious, the bed very large and comfy and overall the room was very clean. The view from the room was breath taking as we had the rice fields view and waking up to that every morning was bliss. The WIFI in the room was a little spotty (we were located on the 6th floor) and seemed rather slow unless we sat near towards the door (which is most likely closer to the access point). However, WIFI in the lobby and restaurant were extremely fast (around ~10Mbps) so they should probably improve on the signal in the rooms. Since breakfast was bundled with our room, the breakfast is your standard fare - generally sausage, bacon, beans, mash potato, potato tarts, curry, congee, breads, fruits, cold meats and cheese. They also have a station where two chefs will make your eggs to your preference and one to prepare your bowl of Pho. Food quality, it's rather decent, I actually have no complaints about it. The hotel has various facilities such as the infinity-esque pool (great for taking pictures) and also a gym, which is equipped with two treadmills, 1 crosstrainer, a lat-pulldown, bench press and free weights. I managed to get 3 decent workouts with the provided equipment. Location wise, I would say very good as it is not in the heart of the bustling and tourist heavy Hoi An town but also not that far that it is very inconvenient. Walking from the hotel to Hoi An Ancient Town took about 15-20 minutes. There's restaurants just 5 minute walk behind the hotel (I recommend Wooden House, the food there",

Before we flew to Vietnam we were concerned about the floods on the news in Hoi An; the hotel staff E-mailed us before our flight to let us know that the area surrounding the hotel was unaffected. After our arrival - and indeed throughout the duration of our stay - the staff were attentive, polite and efficient at dealing with all our requests (booking restaurants, recommending sights, booking airport transfer etc.). In particular, one front desk employee Nga was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and WiFi was fast. The hotel is not located in the centre of Hoi An which we liked as it allowed us to escape the noise and lights when we wanted some peace and quiet. Nevertheless it is conveniently located a short walking distance from the Night Market. Would highly recommend Hoi An River Town Hotel!",
