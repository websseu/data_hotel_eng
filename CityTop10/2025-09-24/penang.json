    "detail": "1st time we came to Penang, we stayed here because of the location. It is at the very top of jalan penang and there are so many things around. Bars behind the hotel, places to eat within 2 minutes walk, street market within 3 minutes and at the end of the street market, shopping centers are pretty much accross the road! Although there are other hotels that are located on jalan penang itself, bayview still wins hands down on location. The fact that its at the top of the street means a slightly quieter atmosphere. I mean, you don't want to step out of the hotel 1st thing in the morning to see some locals sleeping on the street, do you? Because that's what you'd get if you stay at the hotels on jalan penang. The band they constantly have performing each night is very good too. Sometimes after a hot day walking around or shopping or whatever you do in penang, you just want to relax and have a drink or two and listen to the band singing your all time favourites and do shout outs when you request a song (or 10!). We came back to penang a year later. And even though we originally wanted to stay in a resort around batu ferringhi, we decided we loved bayview the 1st time and we'd show that appreciation by returning. And were we glad we did. We arrived in the island quite late and was exhausted. We checked in at about 11:30 pm and Izhan (forgot the spelling of the name) asked if this was our first time in penang, so we told him we were there the previous year. After what seemed like 5 seconds, he thanked us for returning to bayview and upgraded us from superior room to premier! That's not even the next level of room up (superior then deluxe then premier then suite). At 11:30 at night after a long flight, I don't ever remember having much energy but I was jumping up and down. So thank you! Overall, aside from location, value, facilities available and all other things they advertise, experience like mine is not something you always get at other hotels. Thumbs up",

    "detail": "This newly built hotel is in the heart of Georgetown - within walkable distance to various night food markets. The view from the hotel is also magnificent, especially the view from the pool. I booked a family room however only realized at site that it is actually two individual rooms connected via a connecting door. And the connecting doors between two rooms open at a weird angle and no door stopper was provided - hence would recommend getting the suite instead for better and more comfortable stay. Check in process was extremely slow most likely due to the crowd during the christmas weekend. However I was extremely unsatisfied with the way the receptionist handled the situation. First I was informed upon arrival at 3.30PM (Noted check in opens at 3PM on the website) that the room will be available in 10 minutes. And yet my family and I waited for an extra 40 minutes until 4.20PM for the rooms. And there were no updates from the receptionist in between the wait. In the end I voiced out my unsatisfactory to the hotel team and was then only been provided with free breakfast for the next morning. In my humble opinion I appreciate honesty in customer service. The receptionist should be honest with the waiting time in order for customers to then make better choices with this spare time - we could have spent the waiting time at a nearby cafe/tourist attraction site instead. This was the only downfall of my stay. Otherwise the check out process was smooth, the hotel's rooms are great, parking is provided with automated car park and other hotel staffs I encountered were friendly and helpful too. ",

I love the car park located on Level 2 & 3. I can access the Lobby Lift and go straight up to my room (via choice of 4 very fast Lifts). Oh yes the Dragon, constructed using recycled mineral water plastic bottle is still being displayed in the Lobby. Great for photos!",

Found the “past neighbourhood still full of energy & activities” like the butcher & sundry shop. Convenient location to retrace my childhood memories of shopping in Campbell Street, watch movies in the Cathay & Odeon cinemas, eating road side stalls along Kimberly Lane & the chendol along Penang Road. This location is most ideal & strategic to complete my purpose. Staff is overly polite to assist & most helpful even to book a Grab to my next stay, Hotel G in Gurney. Love this row of old houses with high ceiling to create a serene & tranquil atmosphere. Nostalgic even because this lobby was the house of my schoolmate in the 1970. The room was more than adequate with delightful ancient touches, especially with the flip open windows and the most surprising ceiling fan. I enjoyed my 3D2N stay in Areca Hotel most wonderfully.

    "detail": "This new hotel in Chulia street offers a great location in the heart of the historical centre of George Town Penang. The room standard is very good. Clean comfortable and nice bed. I tried several hotels in Penang and this one is way better then any of the other ones I tried. The best price quality option in Penang for sure! Great is also that you get 2 free drinks at the roof terrace bar each evening! The owner and the staff their philosophy is to make the clients feel at home and the nice atmosphere at the bar really helps accomplishing that idea. I can highly recommend this hotel and will be back for sure!",
