The tours are very organized and punctual. This time on one of the tours we had to return early as a relative was not well and this was handled considerately and very professionally. This hotel has a grand white marbled floor and red carpet entrance and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are 2 well maintained rooftop swimming pools plus a rooftop bar that has appeared in numerous travel magazines. At the moment they are renovating some of the older room so there is some slight noise in the daytime but otherwise it was not too intrusive. The suites are lovely with large beds, clean linen and good facilities. When next I go back to Ho Chi Minh I hope to return here. ",

    "detail": "We arrived at 10h30 am and room was already available and we were charged $US25:00 for checking in before 14h00 . Lot of money for us Canadians especially that we told the clerk that we were leaving the hotel in four days at 06h00 in the morning and that they could charged again the same amount to another client arriving before checking time. That was our 5th hotel in Vietnam and we never encountered this problem before but we were told hotel policy. As we left, we tried again to be refunded but at 05h50 in the morning we dealt with a night staff that did not cooperate with us again hotel policy was his answer. The final bill was difficult to understand as the amounts in Vietnamese did not match our invoices only the invoice number matched. Again, as we were leaving for the airport and that the employee had limited English speaking we had to pay the bill and move on. That was our last stop from Vietnam having visited Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, Dalat and finally Ho chi minh and never encountered this problem in Vietnam. We left Ho chi minh on a sour note and flew to Siemp Reap. On a good note, the hotel is well located, very nice staff, good food, super nice room but very lousy policy for checking in. Travelers beware checking in before 14h00 it will cost you $US 25.00. Disappointed canadian traveller: Francine Mault ",

There is a rooftop terrace with bar, pool, sauna and steam room. The steam room has a big window direction west, making it very special at sunset. The pools are rather small but big enough for a cool down after a city trip. Staff is very attentive and professional. Especially Dais and Max at reception. And a very big thank you to Ali, the butler at the entrance taking care of everything even before you enter the hotel. I had to box a bicycle and Ali helped me with tools and whatever was needed to do the job... and it was great fun to do it with him together :-) Number one!",

Best of all, the hotel staff are so attentive and friendly. Its budget rate is best enjoyed by booking through agoda. Will love to come back and I highly recommend the hotel to other vacationers in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.",

    "detail": "I would consider this hotel as our number one choice when we are in Ho Chi Minh City. It is the best for the money considering its location and the size of the room. You cannot find another hotel in district 1 that will offer the room that large. The breakfast buffet is nice with variety of disks and are freshly cooked and prepared daily. My wife loves their Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) for breakfast. We also enjoy very much the privilege of the VIP lounge that offers happy hours every day from 5 to 7PM. With all of that, I also want to mention the staff that we are very happy with their service that include: Tran Thi Minh Ha, Nguyen Thi Hong Yen, Huynh Kim Vui, Nguyen Phuong Tram, Lam My Dung, Nguyen Ngoc My, Lam Thi Cam Van, Nguyen Phuoc Tung, Tran Du Hien, Vu Ngoc Huy and Le Duc tai. These guys are great. ",
