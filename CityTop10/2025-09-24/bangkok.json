    "name": "Grande Centre Point Sukhumvit 55 Thong Lo",
    "detail": "This hotel is a 'real' 5 star hotel. I've stayed in three 5 star hotels in Bangkok prior to Grand Centre Point. This beats them all. The staff are fun and consistently polite to guests. They play with the children interact with the guests and add a nice feel to the hotel. Breakfast had flavourful, good quality produce which was great for 320baht if you don't include breakfast in your booking. The design of the hotel is stylish and modern plus the view from our 26th floor room was amazing. You could see Bangkok for miles. head to the pool with a glass barrier around the outside where Bangkok can be seen... as well as heard quite well! One problem with it was the gym it was a little empty however you don't really spend your time in a gym! One last problem was the Spa area. I really wanted to just go inside and see it before I booked anything however this was prohibited. Even when no one is using it you still can't have a look with a member of staff.",

One hotel is without the swimming pool and the more expensive one (i guess) has the swimming pool. The buildings are 1 minut apart. I have stayed in both of the 2 buildings and they are absolutely great. The rooms are really fabulous and have great comfortable beds. With a nice blue lighting to switch on ore off. They have a perfect airo system. Breakfast is really perfect. You have International foods and Thai dishes. It is a great relaxing get away from Bangkok crowd, but with in 4 minutes you are in the nice crowded area. BTS station is very close, and also great dining area's. Or going out! I already recommended this hotel to two others and they were also very satisfied. So i Will book this for the 4th TIME!!!!!! ",

Takes roughly 20mins++ bts if you intend.to go from hotel to BTS Siam and longer if you intend to go to Jatujak. Going by Taxi would be costly. The hotel would be ideal if you intend to go to Mega Bangna as you can get there by going to BTS Udom Suk and then taking the free shuttle bus from there. Another thing is walking from BTS Bangchak to the hotel is quite a distance so I wouldnt recommend anyone with a family or have problems walking due to the inconvenience. That aside we had a pleasant stay at the hotel. Would be great if the hotel could provide a buggy ride (i saw a buggy outside which was never used maybe for decor only) or some other form of transport to pick customers up from BTS bangchak to the hotel and back.",

    "detail": "I haven't stayed in several hotels in Bangkok anyway, but these were the main features that I was looking for in a hotel. 1) Clean and fresh looking 2) Free fast wifi 3) Good breakfast 4) Friendly staff 5) Good location where it's happening for a Solo traveler like me. Boss suites has it all. It is just the best and is not too pricey. I wouldn't call it a 4 star but it is very clean and well maintained. Since it is a new hotel, the interior, decor etc are really attractive and well planned ( like the see through bathroom just in case u have one of those special guests :). It is still a good hotel for couples and families but not the location) The price through agoda was $41 as advertised but it will be $49 before checkout. That's Agoda not Boss suites. Most of the staff can speak fairly good English and extremely friendly. My experiences with the friendly staff are too many in the two days that I've stayed. There is not one improvement that I can suggest for this hotel and that is not an exaggeration. This definitely is value for money. You can rely on the staff for numerous things like free Tuk-Tuk (They got one for me even after hours), help with getting a cab, help with your room and facilities and also suggestions on going around in Bangkok at the reception. And ya, for all those fun loving, crazy young travelers like me , the hotel offers VIP massages for about 500 Baht. They are all professional masseurs but you can take the massage a litte further if you like to :)",

    "detail": "On my last visit in June, I stayed at NANA Hotel for 5 nights and I'll say straight up..., I don/t mind this hotel at all..., it represents excellent value for money and for a very long time it has been the best and most centrally located hotel to take advantage of the Nana Entertainment area. I've talked to many other guests when I have stayed here and they pretty much all come back to stay, year after year..., making the NANA Hotel's clients probably the most loyal guests of any Bangkok hotel. The NANA has a large and very clean pool with plenty of day beds and shade...., theres also an attached large bubbly spa pool surrounded by thick greenery. The breakfast is also quite nice and the staff very efficient. I usually stay in one of the cheaper rooms and it is always well cleaned. I intend returning again in 3 months.",
