The room is just a bed with all the remote & key being the Ipod that was passed to you during check in. The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat. Cups & plates are also provided but do remember to do your own washing once you are done.",

    "detail": "I booked the superior capsule and it's the best capsule I had so far in Japan. Unlike most capsule, I don't need to check out of my room if I stay for multiple nights here and there's also option to choose for cleaning service for the superior capsule (no extra charges). It's like a mini hotel room with your own desk and door and bed... but without a lock. To me that's good enough because the price is great! Bed wise is very comfortable, not too noisy with a huge TV screen. It's comparable to a sky suite. Locker is huge enough for you to put your luggage in as well as your bags and others items (you have upper and lower storage space in the locker). The capsule although within about 5-10 mins walk from train station, its location is great as situated opposite Takashimaya and the most happening street in Kyoto and next to Gion. I will definitely come back here again to stay if I want save some costs on my accommodation in Kyoto and yet comfortable enough.",

After our welcome drink (which was amazing!!) we got few information about the hotel and we have been really pleased discovering the Onsen was a free in house guest facility The Onsen was great we put on our super comfy kimono and enjoyed the hot water tub. Staff was great and really helpful, they even helped us book a great traditional dinner in a restaurant. We didn't really want to leave! I highly recommend this hotel in Kyoto ",

Best located (for my purpose) hotel for me and my small family. There is a kimono rental shop just at the entrance and the selection was small but very beautiful. I personally did not rent from there but from what I can observed, it is a convenient place to start for your kimono experience. They charged around 3900 yen when I was there. There is a small Lawson right across the street from the hotel, in case you came back late from your excursion and in need of refreshment. The shops at Kyoto Station generally close at 10PM.

    "detail": "We stayed at the Sakura Terrace Hotel in Kyoto during the busy last week of November 2013. We paid US$160 per night, without breakfast, but it should be about half that during off-peak periods. The hotel opened in October 2013. It is conveniently located one subway stop south of Kyoto station, with the Kujo station exit right in front of the hotel entrance. Alternatively, it is a six minute walk from the east exit of Kyoto station. The room is 18 sq metres, and has a decently sized attached bathroom/toilet. Comfortable bed and strong flow of hot water in the bathroom. Free wifi, fridge and hot water boiler in the room. Our room was just next to the lift, but there was no noise. Split unit aircon for cooling or heating, but, unfortunately, very limited English language TV. Free washing machine and dryer located on the 4th Floor. Bar and breakfast room on the ground floor. Pleasant English speaking staff at reception. Only smoking room was available at time of booking, but the reception staff managed to switch it to a non-smoking room. Overall, I would rate the hotel as a 4-star, even though it does not have any restaurant or room service within the hotel. (Visitors have lots of food options at the restaurants nearby the hotel or at Kyoto station.) We will definitely stay there again when we are next in Kyoto. ",
