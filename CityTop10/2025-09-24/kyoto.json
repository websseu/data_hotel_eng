The room is just a bed with all the remote & key being the Ipod that was passed to you during check in. The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat. Cups & plates are also provided but do remember to do your own washing once you are done.",

After our welcome drink (which was amazing!!) we got few information about the hotel and we have been really pleased discovering the Onsen was a free in house guest facility The Onsen was great we put on our super comfy kimono and enjoyed the hot water tub. Staff was great and really helpful, they even helped us book a great traditional dinner in a restaurant. We didn't really want to leave! I highly recommend this hotel in Kyoto ",

    "detail": "We stayed at the Sakura Terrace Hotel in Kyoto during the busy last week of November 2013. We paid US$160 per night, without breakfast, but it should be about half that during off-peak periods. The hotel opened in October 2013. It is conveniently located one subway stop south of Kyoto station, with the Kujo station exit right in front of the hotel entrance. Alternatively, it is a six minute walk from the east exit of Kyoto station. The room is 18 sq metres, and has a decently sized attached bathroom/toilet. Comfortable bed and strong flow of hot water in the bathroom. Free wifi, fridge and hot water boiler in the room. Our room was just next to the lift, but there was no noise. Split unit aircon for cooling or heating, but, unfortunately, very limited English language TV. Free washing machine and dryer located on the 4th Floor. Bar and breakfast room on the ground floor. Pleasant English speaking staff at reception. Only smoking room was available at time of booking, but the reception staff managed to switch it to a non-smoking room. Overall, I would rate the hotel as a 4-star, even though it does not have any restaurant or room service within the hotel. (Visitors have lots of food options at the restaurants nearby the hotel or at Kyoto station.) We will definitely stay there again when we are next in Kyoto. ",

    "detail": "The APA Hotel in Kyoto was a good hotel in a great location. The CUBE is right next door for dining and shopping, and your Shinkansen is right there for departure as well. There's a Bic Camera adjacent, if you need electronics. A coin laundry is 15 minutes walk east, by the river. It is entirely possible to walk to Chion-in and Kiyomizu-dera from the hotel - I did it. It'll make you feel like a pilgrim. (Takes about 45 minutes to get there) Really, a great place to stay. It's comparable to the Granvia, but - not being in the station itself - much more affordable.",

    "detail": "Our 2nd time in Kyoto. Glad to have found this hotel. Living Lobby, a perfect place for a cup of coffee and creative work. Near to 2 different train stations, three 7-11 outlets with postcard printing machine, 4 different bus stops and countless bars, cafes and restaurants. Walking distance to 祇園 Gion and next to 先斗町 Ponto-chō. Baggage storage meanwhile waiting for the check-in and also check-out. The amazing team of staffs are friendly and very helpful. Our little boy has been feeling under the weather on the 4th day, the staff recommended a clinic nearby. Also during check-out, a taxi has been reserved a day earlier by the reception staff and was informed it would cost around ¥1500 to Kyoto Station. Taxi arrived on-time. Really hassle free, saved us a lot of time too and the cost exactly as been told earlier. For visitors, do consider to grab a taxi from/to Kyoto Station. We would surely return again. ",
