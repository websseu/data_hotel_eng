    "detail": "Like most of the hotels in Bali, its always great value for the money, that is, if you come from abroad. The location is a mixed blessing, while its right across from the beach, there is basically nothing to speak of in the vicinity, other than a few seafood places with mediocre service and inflated prices. Staff are great, again, Balinese hospitality!!",

    "detail": "There are a lot of really nice things about the W but there are some downsides too. The good: The interior design is very well considered and we appreciated the details. Rooms were excellent, the communal areas were breathtaking and very ... 'cool' (horrifically general word but I think this is what they're intending it to be). The pools were nice and the restaurants were pretty well designed also. The best thing was the sunset - breathtakingly beautiful! Room service was reasonably good also, once or twice they forgot something but on the whole it was above par. The bad: The concierge Whatever whenever never worked - it became a joke that whatever whenever meant that they'd do whatever they felt like whenever they could be bothered. I think this was mostly because they were so understaffed that random staff trying to help jumped in and confused everything. Next, the outdoor areas are badly designed and tiny, for a hotel this size it needs at least 2x the outdoor space to function at a 5 star level. We found ourselves always messing around trying to find available poolside space as if it were a nasty 3 star all inclusive resort. There were no private places however I think if you take a villa you get some garden area but no beachside. The cocktails are totally watered down overpriced for bali. I know that this is an international grade hotel however the drinks to standard as you'd expect globally but were priced about the similarly Lastly: there wasnt really anything balinese, which was a huge shame. Bali is such a beautiful place-attitude, culture, art & craft, it would have been nice if some aspect of this was incorporated -this hotel could have been anywhere in the world as nothing of Bali really came through. Don't be put off, if you're looking for a place which is beautifully designed, beside a beach (where you cant swim) and amongst other premium grade hipster wannabes then this is really your home. ",

I complained about a neighbor being noisy and they did their best to control the situation and also offered me to sleep in a another room for the night. The next day, I found a hand written letter on my bed from the manager expressing his apologies, which really made me appreciate the customer service they have. ",

The only fault I could pick with this hotel was that the Internet in the room was not good. I need to work online now and again which I could not do in the comfort of my room. I had to sit in the restaurant for a good signal when I needed to do work. I found this problem in most of the 4 star hotels in Bali. Apart from that I enjoyed my stay",
