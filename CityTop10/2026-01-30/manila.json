I’m Hotel is the perfect location for a 4 star hotel since it’s in Makati area and if your looking for central area to roam north or south of metro Manila, then I’m in the perfect place for you. So now let’s nit pick, room was clean and no weird odor which is a must. You even get a welcome cake when you enter your room which is a nice touch. Sheets was clean and didn’t seem worn so that a plus. Bathroom has a glass see through from the bedroom which is starting to trend amongst 4-5 star modern hotels but where I’m fails is the design flaw in the bathroom. The floor is flat so water starts to flood after a few minutes which is a fail. Also notice some spots the room attendants missed cleaning in the bathroom which is taboo for 4 star hotels. Shower pressure is strong and hot so thats a plus. Room service food is not bad either, fast and food was great. Roof top bar is fancy and that mixologist makes a mean bloody merry that is very rare find in Philippines. Overall I’m still comfortable giving IM HOTEL a 4 star rating. If you can get them under 5k Pesos or under 100 dollars a night then this place is really worth it . I personally wouldn’t go past that rate.",

There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

The beds were great and the pillows too, I had a great sleep. The little things, TV had a huge number of channels to use, tee and coffee facilities, even a wine bottle opener, nick naks in the writing draw to assist you from paper clips to stapler. The bathroom was big and clean. We dinned on the rooftop, the Mongolian BBQ was not the greatest but was good, more spices were needed and more veg's too. The service was great and the ambiance was excellent. Night time above the maddening traffic of Manila was magic. The pool was excellent, while relatively small it was adequate and refreshing. My daughter loved it. Recommend this hotel .. yes definitely. All the staff were great, guys out front, the front desk crew, waiters and waitresses, cleaning staff all were happy, smiling and accommodating. I have finally found a great hotel in Manila, yes I will return.",

    "detail": "Much like a 5 star hotel. The size of the room was more than adequate. The pillows and mattress were top notch. The room was immaculately clean. The television was a smart TV so we were able to watch a movie by connecting our phone. There was even a jbl speaker! The staff were amazing too. Check in and check out were hassle free . Buffet breakfast was not yet available when we visited. Nevertheless, there were several restaurants at a walking distance. For the price point, it was definitely worth it The only downside was the traffic going there since it's located at Kalayaan avenue. Otherwise, it was perfect. ",
