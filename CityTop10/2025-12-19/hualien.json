    "detail": "Walking distance to and from Hualien Station. Just look out for a bright yellow building which is very visible from the station. Staff service is impeccable and exemplary. They would drop whatever they are going just to greet you aloud, like Japanese style. Close to dining options too though bit far to night market. But no fault of theirs. 1st hotel we come across that serves supper and its so sumptious with noodles, porridge etc which can be considered as late dinner. Lots of variety for buffet breakfast too. You will be spoilt for choice. They tried to arrange a Taroka Gorge day trip for us. But travel agency advised not to go there as they are falling rocks and stones. Instead we spend time in Hualien city instead. We book a business double but they upgraded us free to a quad room with 2 queen beds equipped with a bath tub. 2 thumbs up to them. Only issue is sound proofing can be better. You can literally hear conversations when people talk and pass by the corridor outside. ",

Which they were more than accommodating. I also had difficulty booking a return ticket to Taipei and the staff worked diligently to obtain a ticket for me and even went to the train station to purchase the ticket for me. They were very courteous. The location is excellent, a 10 minute walk to the night market and located right in the city center. The free shuttle pick up from the train station is a big plus. The hotel and facilities were accurately reflected in the photos online. ",

    "detail": "Location is very strategic and convenient because it’s very near Hualien station. Wherever u wanna go in Hualien, it has the best location to go from because most public buses and trains are all accessible here at Hualien station. It’s a green building hostel and easily spotted across from the station. There’s a cafe at the entrance of the building, or other alternatives like 7-11 is just a stone throw away. Beside the building is Hualien’s very famous Mochi Store which tasted superbly good. Hostel service was really beyond expected. Months before check-in date I was already contacted by their staff members via WhatsApp regarding on our itinerary and booking assistance whichever that we required. Or even just a simple enquiry that u may have about Hualien, they would be glad to answer or assist with. We managed to reserve 2 outdoor activities that we wanna participate in Hualien through their assistance in the bookings and the best part is we could make payment on our check-in date itself, without going through complicated bank transfers or emailing of personal documents. Through WoW Hostel helps to save up all the hassle and complicated procedures. Hygiene for the hostel is really, really clean. I have never seen such a clean hostel and their hygiene really impressed me. Facilities of the hostel is very pleasant and cosy. Very old school/retro vibe environment and simple toast and coffee provided for Breakfast every morning. Beds are quite comfy and sufficient space provided for luggages, adequate privacy and space if you’re staying in dormitory style rooms. Language communication maybe a bit difficult if you can’t communicate in Chinese, but some of the staff there knows little English so they will try their best to help u. Overall it’s super value for money, I will always come back here if I ever get the chance to travel around Hualien the next time.",

They let us borrow the hotel umbrella (for the whole day) which I think not many hotel do so, i consider this is something that need to be mention as extra point. Good service by the hotel staff and some of them can speak English. The best thing about the hotel, they do provide free laundry service which they will show where the washing machine/ dryer location are. Overall, I really enjoy my stay here.",

Hualien's attractions are sporadic - so it is a lot more efficient to stay nearby the inter-state station than trying to find a place nearby some of the attractions. Plus, most of the main attractions are outside Hualien and you will need to take the bus to get around. 3) Very clean 4) The staffs were very hospitable, excited and cheerful. I was very impressed with their customer service. I left a metal ear pick in my hotel room after I left which I could not care less, and the staffs called and even sent me an e-mail stating that they were more than happy to post it! A bit extra but hey, for a small hotel in a small town, this hotel has better customer service than some of the 4-5 star hotel I had been to. 5) You can hire bicycles for free! As mentioned earlier, Hualien 's attractions are sporadic - riding a bicycles would make your trip a lot more fun! I personally feel like a stay in Hualien is incomplete without riding a bicycle around the town - plus it is free!",

    "detail": "About 5 to 10 minutes walk for Hualien train station. The front desk (Jack, Nick when I checked in and a lady when I checked out) is very friendly. They will try to answer any questions your may have regarding Hualien/Taiwan. Simple clean and comfy room. I like the sitting area where you can chill after a tiring day out. However, please take note the check in time is 3pm. I was there at 2:30pm and there were no person to attend to me. I could not even enter the premise. Perhaps that is something the management can look into. Even we cannot go into the room, at least there is a reception to allow us to leave our luggages etc.",
