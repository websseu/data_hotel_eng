    "name": "Kokotel Chiang Mai Nimman",
    "detail": "1. Comparing with the other hotels in Chiang Mai, Kokotel's price is very cheap. 2. The location is far away from the Old Town (4km which is not able to walk under the hot weather). You always need to take the tuk-tuk or songthaew to the Old Town. The hotel is near the Nimman District and you are able to take a walk about 10 minutes to the Nimman District. The location of the hotel is difficult to describe, most of the drivers did not realize the exact location. It would be better to ask the Road Number in Thailand Language in order to tell the tuk-tuk / songthaew drivers. 3. Room is clean and the toilet is also clean. 4. Staff is nice and helpful. They will provide the tourist information for you such as the Saturday/ Sunday night market. 5. Providing a breadfast starting from 07:00AM to 10:00AM. Helping us to call the airport taxi service at mid-night. Although the taxi service is not provided by the hotel, the taxi driver is also polite and helping us to take the luggage.",

The staff speaks very good english and are always providing advice on where to go, and how much the fares should be. When we bought some apples from the open air market and tried to borrow a bread knife from the kitchen at De Chai, the staff offered to slice them up for us. 15 minutes later, the staff came to our room with a beautiful place of nicely sliced apples. This is what differentiate De Chai the Deco hotel from all the other Chiang Mai hotels we have previously stayed in. The attention to the little details. ",

    "detail": "Chiang Mai can get real expensive during the high season, but this hotel is one of the rare finds when you're not looking to bunk with strangers in a hostel. Located a bit outside the city center, you can definitely find all you need for a good night sleep. The staffs are super friendly, rooms are clean, and the location is peaceful and quiet. There were a few flaws to my stay: the room phone we're wired when we arrived, the bathroom smelled a bit funky, the door lock wasn't working, and the shower was a bit broken, but the staffs handled them very swift and professionally and we were all good by the second day of the stay. It might not be as convenient to get here if you don't have a mode of personal transportation (rented car or bike), but if you do, there's plenty of roofed parking available with 24 hours security. Overall it was a pleasant experience, would come by again if I ever need another budget stay in Chiang Mai. ",

There are some restaurants in the hotel, and two on the rooftop, of which one has a live band playing most nights. The cocktails that are served are also not bad. It is not located in the old centre of Chiang Mai but more close to the hipper and newer Niman neighborhood. A lot of restaurants, bars and shops can be found here. It is also on the way to Doi Suthep. All in all, I was very satisfied and I did not expect to have such a great time at a big chain hotel.",

The breakfast buffet has much variety, catering for all tastes and there are many staff on watch to top up your coffee. The Lobby tourist information desk is helpful. It is 10 minutes’ walk to the Night Markets however, they have become overpriced with limited variety of goods. However, this is the best location nearby for a wide range of mid to higher priced cafes, restaurants and bars. Without these markets (starting at 6 pm) the nearby eating, drinking and shopping options are limited. Chiang Mai is a large city where tourist attractions are spaced a long way apart. There is not really a central Chiang Mai location for a hotel. There are plenty of transport options from the Empress. The airport is some 20 minutes’ drive away, costing around 160 THB by taxi. Chiang Mai has a very broad variety of attractions and a range of organised tours are available. Such tours usually include visits to wildlife and adventure activities plus jewellery and craft stores. The craft and artistry in Chiang Mai are amazing and worth seeing but can be expensive to buy. The taxi driver from the airport gave his business card, offering pre-arranged tours or a full daytime charter costing 2000 THB where you chose where you go or not go. I chose to focus on the religious, cultural and historical attractions. Visiting only these attractions took 2 full days and the driver visited many wonderful modern and ancient places. Before, I did not know that Chiang Mai had such a rich ancient history, ruins and similar attractions. These are not that well promoted as wildlife, adventure and crafts seem to have the best publicity. Sadly the Chiang Mai Zoo, which was amazing before, has gone down badly and is obviously struggling. The big drought in Thailand is not helping matters. After the disappointment of the Chiang Mai",

    "name": "Top North Hotel",
    "detail": "This is about the 8th time we have stayed at Top North, why? Because it is inexpensive, central to everything, clean and generally quiet. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast whilst not lavish is suitable and sufficient for the general traveller. One not of caution, this time we were allocated room 407, which was roomy, clean and comfortable and provided a quiet nights rest. However for the infirm or elderly the shower/bath may be an issue as it stands approximately 70 cm - 2'4 inches high making access difficult for the elderly or anyone with hip or back problems. Our friend was allocated room 400, which had a lower shower/bath access. The owners have over the years slowly improved all the facilities in the hotel and it is now (for me) one of the best 'value for money', location wise hotels in Chiang Mai, with its large pool, pool bar and in-house massage facilities.",

    "detail": "The Art Mai Gallery Nimman Hotel is located a block from Nimmanhaemin Road in Chiang Mai, a short drive from the airport. The area features many restaurants and shops. The Maya Shopping Center is a short walk away. Our room at the third floor, which featured Pop Art, was compact but adequately sized and very comfortable. The bathroom was well designed and relatively large. The room was excellently soundproofed. Despite looking out at the road, we heard almost no street noise. The staff was warm and welcoming. The front desk was well organized and easily able to answer our questions. The restaurant staff did an excellent job handling the busy morning buffet breakfast. Rather than have egg dishes on the buffet, servers take orders and have them individually prepared. We enjoyed viewing the paintings in the art gallery. Our friends in Chiang Mai had no problem finding the hotel. However, it is a 15 to 20 minute ride by tuk-tuk into the center of the old town where many of the temples and museums are located. Nonetheless, we would recommend this well-run hotel to friends, especially if they wish to stay near Nimmanhaemin Road or Chiang Mai University. ",
