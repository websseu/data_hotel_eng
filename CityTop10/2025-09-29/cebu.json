    "detail": "Regarding the Five Star Radisson Blu Hotel in Cebu on a scale of 1 to 5 we rated it at 10! We just had our 12th beautiful experience at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Cebu, Philippines. The staff once again are considerate beyond belief, friendly and helpful making our experience very enjoyable. The food is great, the room service from Aaron and housekeeping from Jenny. Outstanding general attention and kindness from all levels of management and staff including a very warm and extremely hospitable Dazzle, Richard , Sabrina still a trainee but beaming with a promise. and too many persons to be able to cite by name but all of them outstanding and much appreciated. The hotel operators like Farah and Adel are both very helpful and accommodating. Another, impressive memory was during our latest visit when Rose, the business executive manager when learning that I was temporarily ill send her assistant to bring me Gatorade. The staff at the swimming pool have always been extraordinary in their attention to our needs and comfort which we appreciate. We are deeply indebted for the fine service at the pool from Charisma who is always been very kind and thoughtful in making us feel at home and comfortable. The food is excellent with new creations and innovation with their NEW OUTDOOR RESTAURANT you can really dine with the StARS and have Romantic evening with candlelight to make guests love the outdoor meals served including superior and premium steaks that my wife and I dearly loved,that WE DINE 2 nights in a ROW ! Lastly, Sous chef ,Joeffrey and executive chef Roberto Kunitz are wonderful in terms of their service to customers and are much appreciated by this customer and family. A hallmark of this beautiful restaurant is there breakfast Buffet which is the most elegant and varied breakfast buffets I’ve ever tried in my worldwide travels. The food is not only delicious but is served by the staff with loving care and attention to the guests is”exceptionnel” ",

    "detail": "I have stayed at Cebu Parklane several times now. I have also stayed in The Waterfront Lahug and other Cebu hotels such as Century Park Plaza. However, the Parklane remains my favourite as it gets the balance right between value for money and comfort. The hotel is friendly. The restaurant is very good. The included buffet breakfast is excellent with wide variety of foods from sushi to omelettes There is something here for all nationalities. Cold cuts for Europeans, traditional Japanese, Filipino and western breakfasts are all catered for. The rooms are spacious and clean. there have been some room renovations and this has served to update the decor and comfort. Ayala Mall is across 2 roads, within walking distance and there is a multitude of shops, restaurants and night spots within. This hotel is in the City so its not a resort or a place where you can lounge by the beach But its located in the newer part of the CBD and, there is much night life nearby. Its also a good location if you are doing business in Cebu. ",

    "detail": "i originally planned on staying at the quest hotel for a week, but ended up staying a month. value for money when i was here in may-june 2012 the value for money was incredible. i paid around us per night without breakfast. by comparison, the cebu marriott, was running around us per night – a little over twice the price, and i imagine no better quality. i looked at half a dozen hotels in cebu before settling on quest. other hotels in cebu running in the $50 - $60 range don’t even come close in terms of quality. and my high expectations were met after i moved in. location the location is great, right across the street from the ayala mall, which is the most upscale mall in cebu. ayala a good place to hang out with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops with fast internet connections. (unfortunately, like most hotels the internet connection at quest is a slower than i would like for my work.) quality the hotel is brand new. when i first arrived they were still finishing outfitting the upper floors. it is impeccably clean and everything is brand new. the rooms are well designed, and the hotel has a clean, spacious feel to it. despite being near a busy road, i heard almost no noise from outside and always slept soundly. food the philippines are not renowned for the food. i haven’t had a meal here that impressed me. having said that, the food in the hotel is the best i have had in the philippines. it’s the same standard as you’d expect of hotel food in a us hotel that knows how to do food well. not just a generic menu designed to serve the lowest common denominator, but actually a good menu with really good food. (they do have all the regulars like steak and burgers, but they do it well.) friendly staff the staff have been consistently friendly and helpful. i feel welcomed every time i enter the hotel at whatever time of day or night.",

The service by the staff was amazing, room and housekeeping the best and food, off the charts. The best breakfast buffet ever and I'm serious, the Cafe is the best. If you want an experience like never before visit the Twighlight Rooftop Lounge. Keep up the great work Bai Hotel, I will be back again and again when I return to Cebu.

And the room deco is spotless. If you took photos, you could use them in a brochure to advertise condos or something And unlike many CEBU hotels, a hot shower is available at any time of night or day. How many times have I found only cold water in the later evening - including the Bayfront hotel. So many hotels here go so far as to only turn on their water heater between ~7 and 10 AM Area is fine, unless you need to be close to the airport for an early flight. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. They'll give you directions to stuff and also warn you if you'll end up in a seedy area.",

    "detail": "Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino is by far one of the best hotels in Cebu, and perhaps even in the Philippines. The rooms are quite spacious and classy. It is fully carpeted and the bed is huge and very comfortable. But the best asset of the hotel is the entertainment readily available to the hotel guests. To top it all, the hotel houses one of the best casinos in the country. The hotel also has a duty free shop where guests can buy items for less than in ordinary stores. Another good asset of the hotel is the buffet breakfast they offer where a guest could choose from among a wide variety of food and beverages. All in all, I highly recommend staying at the Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino.",

Room service was served cold and one of the dishes was overcooked; we requested new service and were happy with the replacement dishes. We again had food served cold in the restaurant the next day which was disappointing, but the staff did their best to address our concerns. Overall, we were happy with our stay and hope the Hotel works on the concerns we shared with them so that the guest experience can be improved. ",
