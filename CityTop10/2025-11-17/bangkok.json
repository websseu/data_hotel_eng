    "detail": "Choosing a hotel in Bangkok is not easy since there are hundreds of options. We visited Bangkok as first-time tourists and we stayed first in Arcadia Suites Phloen Chit for 1 night but we are not satisfied with the location, so we decided to transfer here in Eastin Hotel Sathorn for 2 nights. Location is convenient because it is just right there in Surasak BTS. This is just one station away to Saphan Taksin where the Central Pier in Chao Phraya River is located. From this pier, you can take the Express Boats going to the Grand Palace & Emerald Buddha, Wat Pho, Wat Arun, Asiatique the Riverfront. This hotel is ideal if you are going to visit these spots. But if you are in Bangkok for shopping, I suggest you book hotels around Chitlom Station, near the Central World Shopping Mall and Siam Paragon. Room is spacious, clean, comfortable. The only one thing that is lacking is the toilet bidet. Our stay in Eastin is very relaxing and we appreciate the hotel comfort and ambiance a lot.",

    "detail": "Ok it’s out of town but near my companies Bangkok office, so for me the location was first class, it’s probably about a Thb 200 taxi ride into town, but that’s pretty cheap anyway. Do not expect shopping malls within walking distance of the hotel, as I said it is out of town. Lots of very local food courts and vendors stalls on the roadside, all very good value local food, but again don’t expect pineapple rice and mango salad, this is real local Thai food, not tourist food. Unless like me you enjoy real Thai basic food. There is a reasonably priced restaurant in the hotel if you want it. The hotel staff were very good and the breakfast was ok, I will stay there again on my business vists. ( it’s a 10 minute walk to the office).",

There were no reviews but we figured why not give it a go. The price was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful (and huge), the staff were some of the nicest we've met on our two month trip, so kind and accommodating, location perfect, breakfast good, and everything was so new and clean. We had a truly great stop over in Bangkok thanks to the lovely staff here, they even gave us a room upgrade! It was fantastic, we didn't want to leave. The night we came was actually the first night opened for the hotel! It was less than a day old, very new and super super clean/modern and cozy. During breakfast the head of food and beverage came over and made sure everything was going well. He chatted to us for a while and was super kind, giving us some suggestions on places to visit as well. Overall 10/10 !!",

    "detail": "I'm hard to please, but this was a 5 star stay. We were upgraded to the higher floor category. I'm not sure if the room was any nicer than their standard room but it was nice for us. Our room was fantastic. I read some slightly negative reviews but honestly, from what we experienced, if you complain about the quality here, there is no pleasing you. Agoda is really bad at giving 5 stars to hotels that don't deserve it, but Amari deserves it. Our room was big and very comfortable. The only complaint I could possibly have was the TV reception was grainy, but we didn't watch TV that much so we didn't care. The gym was one of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen. They even had racquetball courts. The pool was a little small for as big as the hotel is but it is very tropically themed and was really nice to relax by. Great pool bar with typical but delicious pool bar food. The dining was great too. We ate at 3 of their venues. The underground pub was perfect for a beer and a steak. They had an outdoor/indoor bar/restaurant that we had some excellent appetizers at. They had a DJ playing there on the outside portion of the deck. Their breakfast was bountiful. One of the best in Bangkok. It was expensive, but it had everything you could ever want. I would suggest you get the room without the breakfast and just use their breakfast buffet for special occasions as it was too much for everyday. There was so much food that you couldn't sample everything unless you had a voracious appetite and then you'd leave Bangkok 20 lbs heavier. The area is why this hotel is cheaper than other comparable hotels. It's a little further off the beaten path. It's in the middle of Bangkok's discount mall and clothing center. If you want cheap shopping, it doesn't get much better. Traffic is horrendous, so the only expeditious mode of travel is by scooter. It's a 10 minute walk from all forms of train.",

They are very efficient in providing what they can to help you. You will not regret it! I am already wanting to visit Bangkok again and Asia Hotel you deserve my business!! Highly recommend. The breakfast buffet is very decent too, I love the fried rice!! Not to mention it is extremely convenient to the main shopping central of Bangkok. Good work and thank you Asia Hotel!",

    "name": "Amari Don Muang Airport Bangkok Hotel",
    "detail": "For those using Don Muang Airport for international or within-Thailand travel, Amari Don Muang Airport Bangkok Hotel is perhaps the most convenient location to rest at. The best thing about this hotel is that it is not near the crowded central Bangkok. But even if you decide to travel to inner Bangkok, taxi meter is not expensive. Don Muang area is very nice to be at. You can travel to Nonthaburi and Pathumthani very easily. If you're here for a shopping spree, The Mall at Nonthaburi, Central Rattanathibet, even Zeer Rangsit and Rangsit Futurepark are all alternatives and far from the beaten path. Food and drinks are available at the hotel, but I'd recommend you learn some basic Thai for conversation, which will help a great deal cos local food providers are just across the road from the hotel, with sane local prices. I picked up a black tea for 160B at the hotel lobby lounge. Across the road? 20B. So do consider learning basic colloquial Thai. Include it as your total travel experience. Learn the language, the culture... and I'm sure you'll be visiting Thailand again, and again... even though your flight is 12hrs far away. The hotel itself has a nice pool which is far from public view, perhaps only visible from the air. This is not a new hotel, but some renovations must have been done at some point in time so it's not terribly old. The rooms are generously big and spacious so no issues if you (and your mate) are giants. Room facilities are all modern and up-to-date. Flat screen tv, hot shower, toiletries... all at your finger's touch. Hotel facilities are also more than adequate. Lobby bar, restaurants, and even a bridge to get you direct from the hotel to/fro Don Muang Airport. Trust me, this bridge (airconditioned) will be very useful to use during the hot seasons, so that you won't have to reckon the heat and the sunlight. Staff at this hotel are all helpful and friendly. Most are able to understand and even give you a lesson in English, if you're from a co",
