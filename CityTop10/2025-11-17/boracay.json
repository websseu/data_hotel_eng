    "detail": "Great beachfront location close to D’mall. Sky pool bar is a huge attraction and definitely is this hotels USP. Infinity pool gets the sun all day and provide the best spot to look at the sunset. John and his team as always know how to look after his guests and make sure you are fully juiced up giving no reason to leave the pool area. Typical Henann surroundings, amenities and hospitality which makes me come back every year to stay in their resorts. I have tried them all and this could well be my favourite Henann in Boracay. But... the breakfast was disappointing as less variety than others. No mango on offer, which is a must for any Philippine resort and the menu was made up of the strangest food combinations which simply doesn’t work. Please Henann... keep it simple, don’t be stingy with food options and Crystal Sands could be the only place to stay in Boracay. It’s easy to criticise when they have raised the bar so high with their other resorts. Saying that, I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!!! ",

    "detail": "Boracay is definitely a great place for a short honeymoon, or a beach holiday. The people are all super friendly and both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The Ocean Club was by far one of the best resorts located along the quieter side of the beach in Boracay. Free beach towels and beach chairs for uninterrupted and peaceful sunset viewing. Although walking back from the main parts of the beach might be a long way, but we always enjoyed these walks along the stretch of beautiful beach. The resort itself was super clean and the staff are all wonderful. Super polite and efficient. Buffet Dinners are the best !!!! BBQ menus are wonderful, and super affordable. The Breakfast spread is also very delectable, I particularly loved that the restaurant set up an egg station. LOVED IT. The resort also can help arrange for transportation (with Island Star or Southwest), from Kalibo Airport at a good price. Other than that! My husband and I are looking forward to go back to Boracay, and we will definitely be staying at The Ocean Club!",

    "detail": "I must give 2 thumbs up for their hotel transfer service, journey from Kalibo airport to Boracay island is full of twists and turns, but they manage to keep track of everything and provide a smooth transfer from land to sea to land, it's highly recommended. It was a surprise for us at the moment we found out the shuttle bus to pick us up is from a 5 stars hotel, turns out Hennan Lagoon is a sister company of a hotel franchise, as a guest there we have free access to the 5 stars hotel's beach and a welcome drink at it's lounge. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The surroundings of this hotel is a bit noisy, but once you step into the lobby it become a different world, room is clean and quiet, swimming pool is well maintained. We had dinner buffet at their restaurant on the first night, food is ok. There are plenty of restaurant at the beach, which is only 5-10 mins walk from hotel.",

    "detail": "We stayed 7 days 3 hotels while we were in Boracay to experience 3 stations (areas). We. 1st we stayed in Henann Primier (station 1), Astoria (station 3), then Crown Regency (station 2). Here our reviews.. POSITIVE: - Airport transfer from Boracay airport to Hotel 550peso for both of us, cheap & must have! Because there are no taxi to get to Boracay. Hotel representative picked up us at exit of Boracay Airport, then transported us to catch a fast boat to Boracay Island, and arrived hotel 20min later. - The hotel representative picked up us at Crown regency in our last day in Boracay!, and transported us back to airport (included in 550 peso that we already paid) - Welcome drinks - Good attitude & always smile staffs - Clean & new - Nice pool access room! - Cost about 70peso to go station 2, to enjoy more shopping & food. NEGATIVE: - Overprice outdoor activities. Should book it at the beach, it is much cheaper. Such as Island Hopping 800p, Zip line/ Cable car 900p, Buggy Car 900p & Jet Ski 2000p. Note: There are no Taxi in Boracay, only have tricycle & e-tric. Very cheap, cost about 70peso to 100peso. Thank you Henann! ",

    "detail": "My family had a splendid vacation at Fairways! Fairways has the best spot in Boracay Island. It has vast estate that houses a number of villas, pools and restaurants and a golf course. It has efficient and prompt shuttle services. We did not have to wait for a long time for the shuttles to arrive. Fairways has many of shuttles that are one call away. The villas are nice, perfect for our family of four. The pools are majestic, esp. the ventana pool that overlooks the sea and mountains. The location is great; away from the hustle and bustle of the busy districts in Boracay. So peaceful, calm and relaxing with scenic views of the sea, mountains and the golf course. The staff are one of its assets. The guards were always ready to assist us in arranging shuttle services. ",
