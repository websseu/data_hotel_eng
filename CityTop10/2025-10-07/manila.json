    "detail": "This is one of the pricier hotels in Manila as it's near the international airport. My favorite thing about our stay in the hotel was the rooftop view from the top floor of the hotel where the pool was also located. You can lounge there while enjoying the view. They also have a sauna and a gym. The staff was also very helpful. They immediately helped me when I got locked out of my room because the automatic doorknob needed a change in battery. The food at the restaurant was delectable. There's a Starbucks on the same building of the hotel and there are a couple other restaurants around the Resorts World area which are easily accessible from the hotel. This hotel accommodated our last minute booking because our supposed first booking at another hotel also got cancelled last minute. Anyway, this hotel turned out to be better than we've expected and it's a great value for your money.",

    "detail": "Stayed in this hotel for three times already, and I will definitely come back again . The location is good, just across NAIA terminal 3 (they provide a free shuttle bus every hour from the airport to the hotel. You can find the buses at the arrival gate at the ground floor of the airport). There are some restaurants around the area, spa, nail salons, dental clinic, pharmacy store, laundry shop , walking distance to resorts world wherein there’s also a small shopping mall, there is a near supermarket as well. The breakfast buffet is good, and you won’t get sick of the options because everyday they change the choices. The staffs were also amazing! I left my watch in the room during my first stay and they notified me and gave it back. On my third stay, I asked my mom to wait for me at the hotel since I’ll only arrive in the Philippines after a very long flight and they assisted my mom and allowed her to check-in early while waiting for me to land in Manila. Every time I go back to Manila, I choose this hotel and I highly recommend it. ",

But if you have guests who drive, then be prepared for a rather narrow, small and very limited car park.",

I stayedin a club room and got it super cheap through agoda, and with all the extras included in club, made our stay something we wont forget. Although like some hotels in manila the view from the balcony wasnt anything to brag about, but was nice to have a Balcony all the same because there are not many hotels in manila that do . It is close to SM Mall and everything you need. I highly rate this place and encourage to try the super value for money .",

    "detail": "This a very new hotel in Manila, perfect for solo or double traveler/s. The room is clean, i love the bed, the pillows are thick and the comforter is like what you found in a 5star hotel. Very comfy! The aircon is big, quiet and ofcourse new! So its very cold. The toilet is quite big, very clean with hot shower and dryer. I like the view from the window, I suggest you to get the ocean view for a great sunset. Its very relaxing. The staff are very courteous. If you want to go to the mall, robinsons manila is 5-10mins walk, or you can take a taxi if you dont feel like walking. Mall of asia is 15-20mins away by taxi. If you have time to get around, theres a lot of good restaurants and bars around the area. The downsides are they only have one chair in the room, they dont offer room service and they dont have restos (as of now, I dont know if theyre planning to have soon), sad to say. If you want to eat and you dont want to go far, there is a conveniet store beside the lobby. ",
