    "detail": "We were looking for a nice quiet location to recover from a very busy holiday period - and we found the perfect place with the Novotel Hua Hin Cha-Am Resort & Spa. First off, the property is located on the much quieter Cha-Am section. Next, all rooms face the Gulf so beautiful views of sunrise and moonrises. Next, the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a very large pool and deck area that allows you to either be close to the pool action or a bit further away - including a sandy beach area overlooking the Gulf (there is, though, really no beach here - but that did not detract fron the property at all). Just a short walk outside the property are a number of small restaurants, bars, and shops that are very typical for Thailand. There are four restaurants on property (and a wonderful little wine bar on the roof - fantastic views). The only down side is that the beach side restaurant has a very limited menu that leaves just a little bit to be desired for that truly romantic dinner - that and a number of mosquitoes that joined us for dinner. The only other down side item (and this is being a bit picky) were the towels - a bit worn and frayed. Other than those two items, we highly recommend this property and WILL be heading back when we once again need a break from the rat race here in the city. ",

Beautiful place to stay, short walk to the beach and easy to get grab car to go anywhere in Hua Hin. Thank you very much to all the lovely staffs at Resort De Paskani for making my stay a memorable one.",

The hotel is large, as are the rooms, and whilst it's comfortable the rooms are very tired, with wallpaper peeling off the walls. As we booked at the last moment we booked via Agoda and paid on arrival, I was a little concerned that after my card had been processed and payment authorised, the lady on reception copied my card details onto a peice of paper, I thought the numbers were blocked out for a reason, the security of the account, she was interested in my concerns. Check-out, as always is painfully slow whilst you have to wait whilst they get someone to check your room. The hotel is ok for the odd night, but probably not for an extended stay, though we would certainly stay there again.",

The swimming pool is small but it was fine for us. The gym is quite small with limited machines, so not the best for those wanting a serious workout. As for the buffet breakfast, it's pretty basic but reasonable for the size of the hotel. The location is great - you can walk to the street market, and to many restaurants and shops. The staff were very nice and helpful. We recommend the hotel, and hope to come back again. ",

The fridge was full of drinks for reasonable prices. The mountain view from the 4th floor was phenomenal. The road the hotel on is a very nice and quiet side street connected to the main road where the baht buses frequently run up & down (10 baht per ride). It's a short walk to the beach and the hotel is situated near a crosswalk which makes crossing the busy main road somewhat easier. The hotel's lobby and entrance is very nicely decorated. I searched agoda.com for a very long time to find the right hotel in Hua Hin, and I am glad I eventually found this place. *Key note: If you stay there, you will likely run into a few stray dogs who hang out on the front steps. BE SURE TO STOP TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES PETTING THEM. THEY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. ESPECIALLY THE OVERWEIGHT TAN DOG. ",

    "name": "Hua Hin Grand Hotel & Plaza",
    "detail": "Stayed on the 15th floor in a recently renovated superior room. Good room and love the view from up there across Hua Hin. Staff are just great here and are always helpful. The breakfast is fine and quite an extended choice for Thai breakfast options. AFAIK in low season they dont put bacon out and only semi warm fried eggs. If you want bacon and say an omelette then just ask and they will knock up fresh for you. Great large size swimming pool and always clean. Ample secure parking to the rear of hotel. Okay the hotel is not on the beach but its a 10 minute walk away with access points near the hilton hotel and a small street near to Market village shopping center, the latter being a far nicer part of the beach and more peaceful but you can still find food and drink there too. Also the Night Bazaar is about a 15 to 20 minute walk and there is a market right outside the hotel but closed on Tuesdays when I was there. Yes its an old hotel but they try hard and the staff are just great. For the price you pay via Agoda it is probably the best deal you can get for your money in Hua Hin.",
