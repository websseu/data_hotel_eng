    "detail": "Really nice luxury hotel in walking distance to near the waterfront and nightlife. Level 14 has a nearly opened rooftop sky bar which would be probably the best location in Kota Kinabalu. There is also a special private club lounge on level 14 which is worth the daily upgrade if you take advantage of the amazing breakfast, lunch and dinner buffers and drinks. The hotel feels brand new and there was lots to see and explore within the complex. The pool on Level 2 is great relief to avoid the day time heat. The daily night market and other markets are very close by which are worth visiting to see more of the real Kota Kinabalu culture. We highly recommend this hotel for couples, groups and for business conferences. We attended a Wedding dinner on Level 3 and the service and atmosphere were excellent.",
