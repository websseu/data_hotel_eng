There are only few rooms, so the area, restaurant and pool are never crowded. There are many nice things to wee nearby by taxi or motorbike. The hotel offers a good transport service. The restuurant is a bit pricy, but its worth it!",

    "detail": "Well after 10 years living in Perth, W.A this was my 1st ever trip to Bali. My booking for flights and accommodation were let a little to the very last minute so prices were slightly higher than one would normally expect to pay. Having said that I was certainly not disappointed with my final choice in accommodation. Both myself and my elderly mother decided to book a 2 bedroom villa with a private pool. On first impression we were both extremely impressed with the share size of our rooms both with personal ensuites, plasma screens, huge beds and probably enough room for another bed if you really wanted to push it. And that was just the bedrooms. Ground floor with a pool that is half underneath the lounge floor. In a nutshell the 2 bedroom 3 level Villa was extremely spacious and probably more room than we required for only 2 people. The staff from reception to front of house to the restaurant to the Kitchen to the cleaners, pool men, Massage therapists even to the guards at the front gate enterance were all absolutely amazing, friendly, helpful and extremely curtious and always greeted you with a smile. The only 2 things I could pick up on was: 1. the lack of sun hitting the pool area. A bit picky and even the staff mentioned this to me. But without tearing down the Villas and trying to start again from stratch or somehow repositioning the sun itself there's not a lot the Villa Staff can help you with here. 2nd The location, a bit of a double edged sword here, it's probably a litte further out of Seminyak than you would like if you wanted to save on Taxi fares or save your feet. Having said that you are just that far enough to be on the edge of Seminyak hence away from the bulk of the main street 24/7 noise. It all really comes down to who you are and what you are after either as an individual or as a group. Outside of the above 2 things I had an amazing time at Villa Kayu Raja and I can not thank all the staff enough for their hospitality and premier servi",

    "detail": "We stayed in Adi Dharma hotel for two nights from April 28-30. This was the first time we visited Bali and stayed in Adi Dharma hotel. We had a fantastic experience! I can say, which I mean it, Adi Dharma hotel is the best hotel I've ever stayed! It has nice location, great facilities, and excellent service. We appreciated the friendly staffs and excellent service! We arrived at the hotel at around 9am, the hotel was nice enough to schedule us a room for early check-in. The hotel also provided car and driver in a competitive price. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. We booked a car to Ubud for a one day trip, but we left a baggage at the car. We didn't think of it in the last day we were in Bali when we packed our luggage to airport. At that time we've already checked out and in another hotel in Nusa Dua. We contacted Adi Dharma hotel to see if we can go to pick up, unfortunately the car was out for a trip with other guests, they would be back after 6pm, but our flight was at 8:30pm. The staff told us time would be too tight, and they were worried we would miss the flight because we needed to be in the airport 2 hours in prior to the flight. At last, they offered to send a car to deliver our baggage to the airport for us. At 6:30pm, we met the driver from the hotel and got out bag back before the flight at the airport. We were thrilled and moved by the service. Thanks so much for their help! We could never imagine a hotel would be so considerate and customer oriented. ",

    "detail": "Wooooooow!!! Even better than it looks in pictures! Don’t judge the outside entrance at all. Vehicles are not allowed through the property so we got dropped off in the front entrance. From the entrance, we got driven with our luggage into the actual villa. We were welcome with some amazing tea and a homemade lei made out of real flower straight from their plantation! From then on, the next two nights were just too magical. We stayed for two nights and didn’t even want to leave! We felt so relaxed. The service were amazing: probably the best service ever! We had Leo to help us out with everything we needed and we could not have been happier. He made sure we were always comfortable and was our private driver from the waterfall! The food here are so on point especially the breakfast for me! We booked an hour appointment with the spa on the first day and enjoyed it so much that we had to book one of their 4 hour package spa deal on the next day. Talk about relax! Amazing service, relaxing spa, gorgeous views, quiet villa- what is there not to enjoy? I would definitely want to come back here next time we come back to Bali and would definitely love to stay longer. Thank you Munduk Moding Plantation for everything that you have done for us to make our honeymoon amazing! ",

The best part about staying at Pradha was their service. We had originally made 2 bookings, 1st one for 3 days in a 1 bed room villa, and 2nd one after for 2 bed rooms when our couple friend was coming to Bali to meet with us. They staff actually gave us a 2 bedroom villa, locking up one of the bedrooms, so that we didn't have to move when they arrived. ",
