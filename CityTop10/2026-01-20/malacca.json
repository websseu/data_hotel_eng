Staff are friendly and relaxed, accommodating for late arrival 1am and late check out, happy to hold luggage. Room has everything you want, kettle, complimentary water, comfortable bed, TV. The bathroom is modern and clean however the shower shares same room as toilet, so that can make the floor wet. This dries quick however so didn't bother me too much. Really excelling location right next to jonker walk - so it's easy to just walk out the door, explore! ",

Over all my stay here for one night experience, my advise for you don't book residence tower as even is new hotel but the room no well maintain and the most important the lift, oh my god this is so horrible!!! I bet 10 customer out of 9.5 are complaining the same problem of the lift! 1) we waited lift just get to our room for more then 15mit , trust me is more then 15mit, there is 6 lift on 3A(reception floor) but only 4 lift can access to residence room and the lift no air-con can you imagine from 3A to level 20th floor(the highest 42 floor) the lift are full and need to stop at almost every floor the smell of sweat in lift so disgusting !空气不流通 2) My hubby call housekeeping ask to send toothbrush set Coz there is no provide in our room and we been wait for more then 40mit . hello is 40mit ,just to get toothbrush !!!! Terrible! I do went to my parents room which in hotel tower at level 11 floor ,the room maintenance and housekeeping/room services and the most important lift much better and faster we ask for extra pillow send to room just within 10mit, same hotel same management but service so much different. 3) on the second day before check out i took shower and wash my hair after all only realize there is no hair dyer at room my hubby call again to house keeping ask for it and still waited for 20mit just to send one hair dyer, really fed up of it My advise to Swiss garden malacca management : Your staff are friendly and good smiling enough, first thing to change is the residence lift must have a solution to solve the main problem and hire more staff. I Will only be back after have improvement otherwise no way, same price we can have many option and better hotel in malacca.",

    "detail": "It took us a while to check in as it has a very small reception, probably as it did not have as many rooms. The guests before us had some deposit issues and the staff (trainee) was unable to handle very well. Although they had up to 2 other staff arrived to handle that issue, they completely ignored us until I insisted to be served and checked in. Rooms are truly spacious and luxuriously decorated but one of the rooms had bad smell emanating from the toilet. I wonder if it is becos hotel was converted from old shophouses. Anyhow, we are quite happy with the rooms so we didn't make an issue out of it. One of the rooms had a huge bed, bigger than a king-sized bed, comfortably sleeping 3-4 persons. Hotel was well located, most places was walking distances away n not too near crowded or noisy places. We walked everywhere to explore the heritage and historical sites. They served set breakfast and their restaurant faces the river, which was lovely to have a meal in the morning as it was very nice, charming and breezy and during the night for beer or wine. Staff are warm and friendly, just maybe not as well trained. Perhaps a professional Manager doing his rounds will help improve matters n straighten out their priorities. We love this hotel and if we ever return to Malacca, this with definitely be our choice stay. ",

    "name": "AMES Hotel",
    "detail": "This is a very new and classy hotel in Malacca. Many of the facilities like sauna, gym etc. are not open yet, but once it is it is going to be an awesome stay. The design is extremely classy, with gold-lined marble tops, drawers with soft-closers, and heavenly bath robes and towels. I especially love how when I scan my room card in the elevator, it will auto-select my floor. There is a good selection of TV channels and Wi-Fi is good enough. Breakfast is a good spread but could still use improvement in variety (I expect they will do this when the occupancy is higher). All staff are very accommodating and helpful, but housekeeping could keep a lower profile when they are cleaning the rooms though. Some things that can be improved on are installing cloth hooks in bathrooms and the air con (the controller in the room doesn't seem to work). Do take note that this hotel is far from town, so if you do not have a car, this is probably not the hotel for you.",
