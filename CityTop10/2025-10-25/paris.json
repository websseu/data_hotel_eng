The kitchen is useful and has most of the necessary itemst that are needed for simple cooking including an electronic dishwasher. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was relatively new and clean. In the lobby downstairs is a coffee machine that can be used for free. The staff was surprisingly friendly and very helpful which is not always the case when traveling and staying in Paris. Even though the room was not cheap (160â‚¬ per night) it's definitely worth staying there because of the central position which made sense for us because we only had a weekend trip in Paris and wanted to see all the tourist spots.",

    "name": "St Christopher's Inn Paris - Gare du Nord",
    "detail": "I arrived at Gare du Nord train station, Paris from the CDG airport (easy - phew!) and found that St Christopher's Inn was easy to find once you navigated yourself out of the station and found your bearings on Rue de Dunkurque (walk towards the post office). Although I arrived early they were very friendly and offered me a shower to freshen up and (paid) lockers to hold my stuff until 2pm check in. If you forget anything like a towel (whoops!), you can rent one for the length of your stay as well as buy other basic essentials. I found the staff very informative, spoke English well and tried their best to accommodate my every need. The room (6 mixed dorm) and bed linen were really clean (amazing doona!), warm and secure. You also got a massive drawer to lock your stuff in under your bunk. The showers were good but the cleaning agent/or disinfectant in the showers/communal bathroom was pretty stinky?! I also found it difficult to keep pressing the shower button whilst having a shower due to a neurological disorder in my arm but I managed. They were of a decent size so you could get changed in the cubicle without getting your clothes wet. The food at night was good (I'm a vegetarian - burger pattie was really dry) but not fantastic. The continental breakfast was on the other hand great and good quality! Baguettes, cheese, cereal, coffee, juice, etc. nice. I also used the laundry facilities up stairs (about 5 Euro wash and dry), which was good. Overall my stay there was great and will stay there again en route back to Oz. Can't really fault anything of locker, towel rent and laundry costs as well as stinky bathrooms but otherwise the location is pretty darn awesome! Thanks guys and gals. Looking forward to seeing you all again!! Oh and the free day tour with Roberta through Paris is so worth it!! Just rug up and don't drink too much coffee beforehand (no toilets!! ha!).",
