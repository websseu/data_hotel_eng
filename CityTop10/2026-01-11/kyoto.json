The troublesome thing is to make sure the ipod is fully charged at all time if not, it will affect on how you can control the light, air & stuffs. There is a place for everyone to mingle & eat.

After our welcome drink (which was amazing!!) we got few information about the hotel and we have been really pleased discovering the Onsen was a free in house guest facility The Onsen was great we put on our super comfy kimono and enjoyed the hot water tub. Staff was great and really helpful, they even helped us book a great traditional dinner in a restaurant. We didn't really want to leave! I highly recommend this hotel in Kyoto ",

It'll make you feel like a pilgrim. (Takes about 45 minutes to get there) Really, a great place to stay. It's comparable to the Granvia, but - not being in the station itself - much more affordable.",

Walking distance to 祇園 Gion and next to 先斗町 Ponto-chō. Baggage storage meanwhile waiting for the check-in and also check-out. The amazing team of staffs are friendly and very helpful. Our little boy has been feeling under the weather on the 4th day, the staff recommended a clinic nearby. Also during check-out, a taxi has been reserved a day earlier by the reception staff and was informed it would cost around ¥1500 to Kyoto Station. Taxi arrived on-time. Really hassle free, saved us a lot of time too and the cost exactly as been told earlier. For visitors, do consider to grab a taxi from/to Kyoto Station. We would surely return again. ",
