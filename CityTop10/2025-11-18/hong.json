Most times you can only check in after 2pm anyway. And the good thing is it is not any more expensive than the normal (and usually much smaller) hotels in Hong Kong City.",

It was very clean, comfortable, and modern. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very efficient! It’s in a great location on Hong Kong Island, and it was a really easy getting from the airport because the bus (A22) practically drops off right in front of the hotel! And it’s only like a 10-15 minute walk to the Hong Kong Convention Center. There are a ton of nice, cheap places to eat, a very convenient place to stay. I especially appreciated the complimentary Handy phone they include in every room, a cellphone with 4G that was super nice to have for navigation and communication while going around the city...much better than buying a sim and worrying about reception and running out of data. Overall, we were very pleased, and hope to stay at The Burlington again when we go back HK.",

All high priced, upscale hotels hand you a map that you need a microscope from NASA to see, and circle the directions. This hotel has taken the initiative to enlarge the microscopic subway map, to further assist their guests. I paid double the price for the other hotels and got the same size room and no customer service from the overstaffed front desk staff. All housekeepers were exceptional in each hotel. However, in addition to the EXCEPTIONAL customer service at this hotel, there is even a rooftop swimming pool to entertain the kids, as well as a spectacular view. Though it may be described by some as older and maybe could be updated, don't be discouraged. And , yep, the rooms are small. . . but it's Hong Kong. And for the value this hotel offers, you can rent two or three rooms for your family for less than one at a 5-star rated. ",

There are many more luxurious and famous hotels in Hong Kong, but at Bishop Lei we can have an excellent hotel, at a very reasonable price. We like the small but functional suites which have a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows. In the daytime we can look down on the Governor’s house and Central, with lots of greenery too. At night we have a fabulous view! The staff is efficient there is a good outdoor swimming pool, and the location, at the top of the Hong Kong escalator is perfect. In the morning we can take the escalator down, and in the evening or afternoon take it up. There are many good restaurants in the lively Lan Kwai Fong area along the escalator path, so it is easy to go out for dinner without having to go very far. The hotel also has a regular shuttle service to downtown and airport express.",

I believe it is quite convenient for business traveler from the Pearl Delta. There is also a great shopping mall just below the hotel. It is very convenient to shop and fetch a ferry back to Macao. Canton Road and Marina corridor, Star Avenue are also within walking distances. I think this is quite a bargain for a centrally located hotel in Hong Kong for its price level. Highly recommended!",

    "detail": "It was quite a walk up the steep slopes and stairs, but hey, it is hong kong after all right? Though the hotel was found sandwiched between two other building, it stood out due to it's small build making it easy to find. Entering the hotel, we were greeted with a very beautifully lobby area which was furnished with modern and contemporary furniture. There were two imacs available for use and even a piano, which i was very much tempted to play but my next to zero instrumental skills prevented me. We were briskly checked in and showed to our room by the efficient, if not so friendly, staffs there. We weren't exactly shocked by the size of the room, having done our research prior to booking the room. In fact, i actually felt that it was better than i'd expected it to be! It would've been very annoying to move around if we had brought big luggages but we were only travelling with backpacks so it wasn't really much of a hassle for us! Besides, when you're in hong kong you wouldn't be staying in that much since there's lots to do. Aside from that, i actually like the fact that the toilet had clear glass walls. It allowed me to watch the telly, not that there was anything to watch actually considering the limited channels they have, and go about my big business all at the same time. Also, toiletries was not provided but can be easily bought from a dispenser at the ground floor, Overall, we're really satisfied with our stay there. It was a really nice hotel with an affordable price. Unless you really don't enjoy small spaces i'm pretty sure you'll like the place! Well, we definitely did and wouldn't mind coming back if i were to visit hong kong again!",

    "detail": "if you're planning to stay at the tsim sha tsui area, then the ymca salisbury hotel is highly recommended. it offers great value for money considering its location, and depending on the type of room you book, it affords you a view of the victoria harbor, which nearby 5-star hotels also offer at a considerably higher price. and while it would be unfair to compare the ymca salisbury to such 5-star hotels in terms of luxury and style, it nevertheless offers more than just the basics and affords one a pleasantly homey, cozy stay. the rooms are big enough and well-appointed, although i was a bit disappointed that they do not have a bidet in the toilet. other than that, there isn't anything else i could complain about in our room. no moldy smells, the room was cleaned & made up every day, plus they also gave us a welcome fruit basket on our first day, and daily rations of the english-language paper, south china morning post. cable tv could use a few more english-language channels, but one doesn't come to hong kong to watch tv anyway, so that's not too much of a big deal. since our hong kong trip this time was basically for shopping, i found that the ymca salisbury is just perfect for it, since it is just a few minutes walk away from the harbour city stretch as well as the countless outlets, boutiques and malls of nathan road, canton road and the side streets up to granville. it is also a mere 5 to 10 minute leisurely walk to the star ferry terminal, where you can board a ferry to hong kong island for more shopping in the central and admiralty areas. the ferry is a cheaper but more fun way to get to central instead of the ever efficient mtr. speaking of which, the ymca salisbury is linked by an exit to the east tsim sha tsui mtr line and consequently, the tsuen wan mtr line as well, so getting around is not a problem. staff were warm & helpful (by hong kong standards), from the ladies in the front desk & the gentlemen in the concierge, to the housekeeping s",
